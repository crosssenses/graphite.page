    <p>History has shown that during crises decisions are often made, which
have far-reaching consequences and will for many decades continue to
affect the way of life of entire societies. These decisions are made
under time and social pressures. Social pressure mounting amidst the
current Covid-19 crisis calls for return to “normality”, which means the
way of life in the pre-crisis period. The proposed “vaccination
passport” is viewed by many as an instrument for such a return. Yet,
there are many challenges, primarily related to the protection of
sensitive personal data, potential abuse by private companies and
governments, and the need to avoid discrimination. The key to avoiding,
or minimize these threats lies in e-governance technological solutions.
Such solutions carry by default and design safeguards against profiling
and arbitrary application, thereby raising confidence among the
“passport holders” that privacy rights secure, and among those who
condition their use of these services upon the data entered into such
passports that the data is accurate and cannot be manipulated. I call
for decision makers on the global, European and national levels to
consider the usage of blockchain technologies or other comparable
solutions as the technological pillar of this necessary development. And
last but not least, I would like to emphasize the importance of
communication between political, academic, medical and civil society
circles. In this communication, the voice of academia as the guardian of
democratic values needs to be consistently heard.</p>

    <p>This comparative study looks into the proposed “vaccine passport”
initiative from various human rights aspects. It was undertaken by the
Global Digital Human Rights Network, an action started under the EU’s
Cooperation in Science and Technology programme. The network currently
unites more than 80 scholars and practitioners from 40 countries. The
findings are based on responses to questions put to the network members
by the authors of this study in February 2021 (<a href="#heading-76">questions below in
Annex</a>). We acknowledge individual contributions from colleagues

proposed “vaccine passport”, whether such a “passport” would create
binding obligations in the public and private sectors or, alternatively,
what would be the scope of discretion allowed to public and private

various services. The attitudes prevalent in different states and in the

    <p>There has been no thorough analysis in most countries as to whether a
normative national basis exists to restrict fundamental rights through
the requirement of having a “vaccine passport” to access certain
locations or services. Compatibility of the proposed passport with
European and/or international human rights rules and principles is a
marginal issue in public discourse. Conceptualisation about such
compatibility remains general and theoretical, and has not reached the
level of practicality and effectiveness. Most countries have not enacted
concrete legislative acts or provisions to deal with a pandemic of this
scale and magnitude.</p>

    <p>The findings indicate a complete absence in the EU countries and
selected countries outside of the EU of the normative basis in national
legal systems which would obligate private companies to enforce
restrictions originating from the “vaccine passport”. This legal vacuum
– provided that such a “vaccine passport” becomes sooner rather than
later a technical and medical reality – raises a subsequent concern as
to whether the private companies have the legal discretion to make
decisions regarding who to serve and who not to serve on their own
volition. This is not a question of a legal obligation to discriminate,
but a legally allowed freedom to discriminate. Provided that normative
concretisation of such a “vaccine passport” within national legal
systems and/or in the EU level is unable to run in parallel with the
accelerated practical requests for such a “passport” from private
entities, we see a real threat of the “private” profiling of citizens
and exploitation of their vulnerabilities for commercial purposes. The
concern, which legal scholarship has been aware of for decades – the
compatibility of private business interests with the obligation to
safeguard human rights when doing business – finds its clear
manifestation when the EU is faced with the quest to find a solution to
the pandemic crisis via the “vaccine passport”.</p>

    <p>The fundamental concern is that the “vaccine passport” can lead to
everyday discriminatory choices by individuals, the public, and private
entities, which in turn become deeply rooted discriminatory patterns
either in practice or law or both. There is a theoretical dilemma and,
for many, a practical issue how to realise one’s fundamental rights to
refuse medical treatment and not to know one’s medical condition when
having a “vaccine passport” is a utilitarian pre-condition for social
participation. We caution against the possibility of public and private
“lists” created on the basis of “passports”. The sooner such “passports”
are issued in normative vacuum or fragmentation, the greater the threat
of profiling. If blockchain technology is to be used for such profiling,
it can lead to “vaccine prisons”.</p>

concern the purposeful use of gathered medical data. A clear and

    <p>The topic of “vaccine passports” is emerging in all corners of the
world, but currently countries seem roughly split on whether there is or
is not discussion regarding an EU-wide (or global) “vaccination
passport”.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>As of February 2021, discussions were taking place in Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom; but lacking in: Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Serbia, South Africa, Turkey.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> There seems to be less discussion of a “vaccine passport”
outside of the European Union. For example, as of February 2021, neither
South Africa nor Argentina were discussing this topic and it was also
not under consideration in regional organisations, such as the African
Union, Mercosur and other inter-American bodies.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 1, submissions from South Africa and Argentina.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> In countries where

such cases, the dialogue on “vaccine passports” is seen as premature as
the focus of governments and the media is mostly on the procurement of
vaccines and the logistics of the vaccination programmes. In general,
the perception is also that there should be free access to vaccines
before a “vaccine passport” could provide special rights or easier
access to certain venues or services (if people have no choice to
vaccinate the potential for discrimination is greater).</p>

Many proponents of a “vaccine passport” see it as a way to facilitate
travel in Covid-19 conditions. For example, the Spanish Minister of

    <p>It is interesting to note that the positive view of “vaccine passports”
in the tourism sector is not universal. This is because some companies
perceive a potential obligation to have a “vaccine passport” as
excessive and more restrictive than the current situation. Some
companies have expressed a fear that such “passports” would only bring
additional restrictions to travelling and consequentially a decrease in
the number of travellers/customers.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 1, submission from Bosnia and Herzegovina, referring to information available at: https://rtvtk.ba/covid-pasosi-rjesenje-ili-dodatno-opterecenje/ accessed on 14 February 2021</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://rtvtk.ba/covid-pasosi-rjesenje-ili-dodatno-opterecenje' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> Moreover, the Malta Hotels and

    <p>Opinion is divided over whether a “vaccine passport” constitutes a new
type of instrument with corresponding new risks. Academics point out
that states already gather large amounts of data about the citizens’

of documenting vaccinations and providing proof of such vaccinations,
especially when travelling, is also relatively well-established.
However, previously such documents have been on paper and the data
contained in them have not been shared amongst different states. It is
important to note, however, that digital uniform versions of vaccination
documents have been proposed even before Covid-19 due to the
impracticality of a paper document (e.g. ease of losing it; ease of
forging it). In addition, the requirement of producing a medical
certificate for accessing some services (e.g. health checks of children
and their guardians for the purpose of being admitted to certain
swimming pools, notably those providing physical therapy prescribed by a
physician) is also common in many states.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 3, submission from Lithuania.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The main potential encroachment of the right to privacy in this context
is the obligation to share personal health information (e.g. when you
travel or want to access a venue or a service) to a wide range of people
and public or private entities. The <strong>proportionality</strong> of restrictions
of privacy in order to curb the spread of the virus has been widely
discussed in relation to “contact tracing” measures such as Covid-19
tracing apps and customer lists in restaurants (specifically
highlighting the potential for the reappropriation of such data for
non-health-related purposes such as criminal prosecution). It has been
pointed out that in comparison to the abovementioned measures, which are
widely considered proportional, the privacy implications of a Covid-19
passport seem rather limited. In most cases, the information when, where
and with what vaccine someone was vaccinated seems to allow
significantly less conclusions about this person than (especially
compiled) data on contacts or frequented locations that were widely
considered proportional.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 3, submission from Germany.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>In assessing the proportionality of a restriction of privacy, it is
necessary to identify whether the existence of a vaccination certificate
system increases health protection. Some authors have noted that
currently there is not enough scientific information available to know:
a) the effectiveness of vaccination against all the existing types
(variants) of the virus, and b) the time period of immunity.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 3, submissions from Greece, Slovenia and Argentina.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>

If the “vaccine passport” were to limit access to services or spaces,
there is a significant risk of discrimination as not all people
currently can (or want) to be vaccinated (due to a lack of sufficient
does of vaccines, etc.). However, this concern is not universally
shared. For example, in Germany, where there is a discussion whether
vaccinated people should be exempt from infection prevention
restrictions, the Federal Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht has
pointed out that lifting fundamental rights restrictions once they
become disproportionate does not a constitute an unjustified privileged
treatment, pointing out that it is not the exercise of fundamental
rights that requires justification, but rather their (continued)
restriction.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 5, submission from Germany, referring to information available at: https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/rechte-geimpfte-101.html.</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/rechte-geimpfte-101.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

people living in remote areas are likely to remain disadvantaged as some

    <p>In discussing potential public space restrictions on the basis of the
“vaccine passport”, it is important to bear in mind European Court of
Human Rights (ECtHR) case law in relation to <em>de facto</em> mandatory
vaccinations. Prior vaccination should not be the prerequisite for the
exercise of fundamental rights, such as the right to education or the
right to work. It was highlighted that Greece has been condemned by the
ECtHR in the case of <em>Sampanis and others v Greece</em> (2008, 2012) in
which the head teachers of two primary schools in Aspropyrgos refused
Roma parents the right to enrol their children on the basis of medical
reasons (they were afraid of the transmission of diseases since the
children had not been vaccinated). The Court found that the Greek
government violated article 14 of the ECtHR. In another important case –
that of <em><a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-6600415-8750713&amp;filename=Relinquishment%20in%20favor%20of%20the%20Grand%20Chamber%20Vavricka%20v.%20Czech%20Republic%20and%205%20other%20applications.pdf">Vavřička and others v the Czech
Republic</a></em>
– where the parents refused to submit to the legal obligation to
vaccinate their children because they considered, in substance, that
such a vaccination was against the interests of their children, they
were sanctioned, denied permission to set up a privately run school and
their children were denied enrolment in a public nursery school.
Although the Grand Chamber has not yet issued its decision on<em> Vavřička
and others v the Czech Republic</em> (which will clarify the ECtHR’s view on
mandatory vaccination and the consequences of one’s refusal to comply
with the national legislation thereon), earlier relevant jurisprudence
does not leave much room for assumptions (<em>Acmanne and others v.
Belgium, Solomakhin v Ukraine</em>) – vaccination is a medical treatment
which demands prior consent and a legitimate goal.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 5, submission from Cyprus.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>Another danger that has been highlighted in relation to the “vaccine
passport” is that introducing special privileges for the future
“passport holders” might in some countries encourage unrest due to the
discriminatory effects that this policy could cause. Additionally, if
governments begin to request this kind of document, it will encourage
private companies to demand it for other activities, with the consequent
discriminatory effect on the population. As proof of this, the example
of the German ticket company Eventim was brought up, noting that the
company had already revamped its online booking service to allow for
customers to upload proof that they had been vaccinated in anticipation
that organisers of events from concerts to sports tournaments will in
future require it as a condition of entry.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Question 3, submission from Argentina.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The study indicates the complete absence of the normative basis in
national legal systems which would obligate private companies to enforce
restrictions originating from the “vaccine passport”. In addition to
noting such an absence, the respondents from different countries have
pointed to some legislative and administrative aspects. For example,
Finland has a prohibition to delegate administrative tasks to private
entities. Private entities in Lithuania are expected to seek assistance
from the public authorities for enforcing restrictions originating from
law. Spain reported the existence of a general legal framework for

    <p>A related issue is whether, in the absence of a legally binding
requirement to enforce the “vaccine passport” when deciding who has and
who has no access to privately provided services, the private companies
have the legal discretion to make these dividing decisions on their own
volition. In the other words, this is not a question of legal obligation
to discriminate, but legally allowed freedom to discriminate. It appears
that some countries see such debates and we have reason to assume that
such discussions will emerge within a relatively short period of time,
therefore the comparative results of this study may soon not represent
the reality. However, we believe that the essence of ongoing and
geographically spreading debates will have similar focus points. For the
purposes of the current study, Romania claims that it is possible for
private parties to establish rules they consider necessary if this is
not explicitly prohibited by law. Under the current legal situation, it
would be difficult to prohibit a restaurant owner to only offer services
to vaccinated people if he or she wants to do so in Romania. German
ministries have not developed a clear position regarding the question of
whether private companies are allowed to exclude non-vaccinated people

    <p>In Lithuania there is an ongoing debate in legal circles concerning
whether the special legal regime presently applied in the country
provides a sufficient legal basis for the various restrictions that are
applied in connection with the declared quarantine. Prof. E. Šileikis
claims that currently imposed restrictions (e.g., of movement between
municipalities) are not legitimate, as an emergency (<em>ekstremali
situacija</em>, <em>karantinas</em>) in Lithuania has not been declared under the
Law on Public Emergency (<em>Nepaprastosios padėties įstatymas</em>) in which
case it would have been declared by the parliament and would provide a
proper legal basis for far-reaching restrictions. Assoc. prof. V.
Vaičaitis holds that restrictions currently imposed in Lithuania by the
government by means of its resolutions (<em>nutarimas</em>) go beyond what is
permitted by the currently applied Law on Prevention and Control of
Communicable Diseases in Humans (<em>Užkrečiamųjų ligų profilaktikos ir
kontrolės įstatymas</em>) and the Law on Civil Protection (<em>Civilinės saugos
įstatymas</em>), but the situation could be rectified by amending the law.
There is some disagreement in legal circles on whether a public
emergency should be declared by the parliament or whether the formally
more lenient legal regime is sufficient in the current conditions.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Vilnius University Faculty of Law conference, 04/02/2021, http://www.teise.pro/index.php/2021/02/05/covid-19-pandemija-issukiai-zmogaus-teisems-demokratijai-ir-teisines-valstybes-principams/.</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='http://www.teise.pro/index.php/2021/02/05/covid-19-pandemija-issukiai-zmogaus-teisems-demokratijai-ir-teisines-valstybes-principams' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>

    <p>If vaccine certificates were also to be required after the pandemic and,
consequently, after the revocation of the special legal regime of
emergency of one kind or another, the requirement to have vaccine
certificates would raise questions of a different kind, similar to the
one of whether there is a legal basis to admit to nursery schools the
children whose parents refuse to have their children vaccinated (unless
there are counterindications) with standard vaccines (against measles,
rubella, poliomyelitis). The Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania
in 2016 (case no. I-6-662/2016) found a requirement to have children
vaccinated unconstitutional but, in that particular case, only because
such a requirement in Lithuania stemmed not from a law adopted by the
parliament but rather from a hygiene norm adopted by the Minister of
Health. The Court relied on the ECtHR case law and addressed the issue
of vaccination under Article 8 of the ECtHR holding that vaccination was
an interference with the physical integrity of a person, which fell
within the scope of the right to private life. Restrictions of this
right are possible but need to meet certain requirements including that
of having a proper domestic legal basis. As a result of the above Court
decision, the requirement of vaccines was dropped.</p>

    <p>It is noteworthy that currently the Lithuanian Law on the Prevention and
Control of Communicable Diseases in Humans (Article 11 § 1) provides
that immunoprophylactic measures shall be administered upon the person’s
consent unless other legal acts provide otherwise. At present there are
no such laws (in line with the abovementioned case law, acts of a lesser
legal value would not suffice as a basis for an obligation to get
vaccinated). Furthermore, the government is currently opposed to the

    <p>From a purely rights perspective, the possibility of a “vaccine
passport” which can have a decisive effect if some doors are opened or
remain closed to rights holders, is connected to questions about the
scope and universality of some concrete human rights. The right to
privacy contains the specific right to say no to medical treatment.
Contemporary scholarship does not exclude that there is also a right not
to know one’s medical condition, which by default excludes disease
testing and vaccination. If the “vaccine passport” becomes a universal
instrument of social control enabling full participation for some and
blocking others out, then the decision as to whether to get vaccinated
or not may no longer be a matter of free choice but rather a recognition
of necessity. The view from human rights scholarship points to the
absolute nature of the right to refuse medical treatment and not to know
one’s medical condition, which does not become compromised due to the
utilitarian need for social participation.</p>

Global Digital Human Rights Network, an action started under the EU’s

findings are based on responses to questions put to the network members

proposed “vaccine passport”, whether such a “passport” would create
binding obligations in the public and private sectors or, alternatively,
what would be the scope of discretion allowed to public and private
entities to make their decisions affecting rights holders’ access to
various services. The attitudes prevalent in different states and in the

    <p>There has been no thorough analysis in most countries as to whether a
normative national basis exists to restrict fundamental rights through
the requirement of having a “vaccine passport” to access certain
locations or services. Compatibility of the proposed passport with
European and/or international human rights rules and principles is a
marginal issue in public discourse. Conceptualisation about such
compatibility remains general and theoretical, and has not reached the
level of practicality and effectiveness. Most countries have not enacted
concrete legislative acts or provisions to deal with a pandemic of this

    <p>The findings indicate a complete absence in the EU countries and
selected countries outside of the EU of the normative basis in national
legal systems which would obligate private companies to enforce
restrictions originating from the “vaccine passport”. This legal vacuum
– provided that such a “vaccine passport” becomes sooner rather than
later a technical and medical reality – raises a subsequent concern as
to whether the private companies have the legal discretion to make
decisions regarding who to serve and who not to serve on their own
volition. This is not a question of a legal obligation to discriminate,
but a legally allowed freedom to discriminate. Provided that normative
concretisation of such a “vaccine passport” within national legal
systems and/or in the EU level is unable to run in parallel with the
accelerated practical requests for such a “passport” from private
entities, we see a real threat of the “private” profiling of citizens
and exploitation of their vulnerabilities for commercial purposes. The
concern, which legal scholarship has been aware of for decades – the
compatibility of private business interests with the obligation to
safeguard human rights when doing business – finds its clear
manifestation when the EU is faced with the quest to find a solution to
the pandemic crisis via the “vaccine passport”.</p>

    <p>The fundamental concern is that the “vaccine passport” can lead to
everyday discriminatory choices by individuals, the public, and private
entities, which in turn become deeply rooted discriminatory patterns
either in practice or law or both. There is a theoretical dilemma and,
for many, a practical issue how to realise one’s fundamental rights to
refuse medical treatment and not to know one’s medical condition when
having a “vaccine passport” is a utilitarian pre-condition for social
participation. We caution against the possibility of public and private
“lists” created on the basis of “passports”. The sooner such “passports”
are issued in normative vacuum or fragmentation, the greater the threat
of profiling. If blockchain technology is to be used for such profiling,
it can lead to “vaccine prisons”.</p>

    <p>Challenges related to <em>safeguards</em> during implementation primarily
concern the purposeful use of gathered medical data. A clear and
specific normative basis is necessary, since the generally worded
legislative or constitutional level norms may not be sufficient to
protect personal data.</p>

    <p>The Working Papers of the <a href="https://gdhrnet.eu/">Global Digital Human Rights Network</a> – edited by Mart Susi and Matthias C. Kettemann – addresses both idealistic as well as practice-oriented dimensions of the field. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series attempts to reverse this pattern and with the Network’s capability looks to to break or at least question the strengthening grip of the online companies as powerful actors in defining the image of human rights in the digital landscape.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19143/">GDHRNet COST Action</a> will systematically explore the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of human rights. The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility. </p>

    <p>The Action will propose a comprehensive system of human rights protection online, in the form of recommendations of the content assessment obligation by online companies, directed to the companies themselves, European and international policy organs, governments and the general public. The Action will also develop a model which minimizes the risk of arbitrary assessment of online content and instead solidifies standards which are used during content assessment; and maximizes the transparency of the outcome. </p>

    <p>Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and collaborate. All the information can be found in the booklet <a href="https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-cost/coronavirus-covid- 19">“COST Actions against COVID-19 – An interdisciplinary network” </a>.</p>

    <p>As the full consequences of the current pandemic are yet unknown and the threat of a future pandemic is always present, the Network of Actions offers considerable potential in mobilising experts and tackling challenges as they arise. The Network is open to other participants and completely bottom-up. Any Actions wishing to join it can do so by contacting the COST Science Officer coordinating this initiative. </p>
