      <p>In January 2021, a great “deplatforming” took place: Numerous internet platforms suspended the accounts of Donald Trump and his supporters. Private power over public speech is often contested, but the conflicts are magnified when this power is asserted over parties, political candidates and office holders that function as focal points for public debates. While most platforms’ terms of use and enforcement systems are global, opinions relating to any preferential treatment of speech by well-known political figures and office holders vary across national political and legal contexts.</p>
<p>This study examines the interplay between these national conceptions and global private ordering systems by synthesizing answers to nine questions submitted by more than 30 researchers from 15 countries within the GDHR Network. It provides a first overview of how societies and governments conceive of and react to private power over political actors.</p>

    <p>2021 thus began with an important realization: platforms can intervene (and remove content and users) very effectively if they want to. Even during the U.S. election campaign, they limited algorithmic recommendations, banned political ads, demonetized and deamplified problematic content. In general: 2020 was the year in which platforms (re)discovered that the fight against disinformation, especially in the context of the fight against Corona, also appeals to politicians and customers.</p>

    <p>But if politicians themselves are at the core of the problem? Are platforms allowed to remove them? And what about political parties? If platforms should be allowed to act at least in certain circumstances, how exactly should these decisions be made within them in terms of deciders, processes, justifications and opportunities to appeal?</p>

    <p>Across the world, societies continue to negotiate who the <em>least-worst</em> actor to control speech on the internet is, states or private platforms. The question of how to reign in harmful speech by government agencies or public office holders shines a light on the downsides of both approaches. State involvement in how official information is or is not disseminated by private actors is not only met with scepticism, but also subject to significant constitutional constraints in many countries. Vice-versa, the increase of platforms’ power over societal discourses that comes with them restricting democratically elected officeholders or determining the rules for political campaigns based on private terms of service is similarly hard to accept.</p>

    <p><em>Klaas</em> <em>Slootmans</em> (Vlaams Belang - Flemish nationalist, far-right party) heavily criticised the actions taken by social media in the context of the storming of the U.S. Capitol, stating that the decisions to suspend Trump's accounts were not taken by a judge or a media regulator, but by billionaires pleasing the next president of the United States. Whereas the alleged goal of the measures taken was to avoid further danger, at the same time other authoritarian leaders, such as Erdogan and Duterte, may continue tweeting, <em>Slootmans</em> added.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>K.

Accordingly, he held that, other than legislative initiatives, a strong political signal denouncing such practices was needed - and currently missing - in Flanders. He underlined the importance of freedom of expression and asked the minister how he will guarantee this fundamental right of the Flemish people. In his opinion, opinions and information should only be banned from social media in case they violate the law.</p>

    <p>Criticising Trump for his actions, <em>Willem-Frederik</em> <em>Schiltz</em> (Open VLD – Flemish Liberal party) also stressed the importance of the right to freedom of expression. However, he also stated that this freedom has limits, which are laid down by law and enforced by judges. In that context, he held that tech giants seem to have overtaken this role on social media today, adding that this cannot be tolerated. According to him, it needs to be examined how social media <em>can</em> ban content that violates the law, while also making sure they do not ban legal content. Lastly, he pointed to the fact that algorithms to a large extent determine which information and ideas are to be seen by users, thus impacting the formation of their opinions as they are built on information and ideas. Accordingly, he asked the minister whether we need more transparency as regards content curation on social media to protect freedom of expression.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>W-F.

    <p><em>Peter Van Rompuy</em> (CD&amp;V - Flemish Christian-democratic party), in that regard, asked Minister <em>Dalle</em> a question about ‘the impact of tech giants on freedom of expression’. <em>Van</em> <em>Rompuy</em> said that three lessons can be drawn from the storming of the U.S. Capitol. According to him, first of all, messages of hate and violence sooner or later effectively lead to violence. Second, he held that the power to determine the limits of the freedom of expression should not lie with private platforms. Under the rule of law, independent institutions and judges determine those limits. In that context, he referred to the EU Commission’s proposal for a Digital Services Act (DSA). Thirdly, he referred to the illegality of incitement to hatred, violence, discrimination and human trafficking in an offline context and added that all this should also be tackled in case it occurs through social media.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>P.

    <p>In answering these questions, <em>Benjamin Dalle</em> (CD&amp;V - Flemish Christian-democratic party) considered the definitive erasure of Trump's social media accounts as a severe interference with the rights of the former President. According to the Minister, the question is not whether this decision is a good one, but rather whether the people who took the decision were well-placed to do so. He stated that “<em>he is not ready for a democracy where the CEOs decide which opinions he gets to see.</em> <em>That is not their job</em>”.

In particular, he made a distinction between ‘illegal’ content - such as hate speech - and ‘false information’, the spread of which is, according to him, not illegal. In that regard, he referred to the funding by his cabinet of media companies to tackle this problem, pointing to the added value of technology and algorithms in particular.</p>

    <p>Geert <em>Bourgeois</em> (NV-A, Flemish nationalist-conservative party), and member of the European Parliament), during a TV interview with the public media broadcaster, said that social media can now decide themselves which opinions can stay online, and which ones are banned. According to <em>Bourgeois</em> this is unacceptable. He thus proposes a universal or public service obligation for social media companies: they need to accept everyone who wants to post opinions to their platforms and the fact that people want to get information via their platforms. In his opinion, social media companies are the letterboxes of the 21st century. He stated that the right to freedom of expression is a fundamental achievement and that the limitations on the right to freedom of expression are limited and should be laid down by law. In that context, he referred to the prohibition of censorship laid down in Article 25 of the Belgian Constitution, as a result of which the right to freedom of expression may only be restricted ex-post (in the context of civil or criminal proceedings). He wants to maintain this principle also with the DSA.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>NV-A tweet on G.

He further referred to the contribution of social media to the <em>Rabbit Hole</em> (“<em>fabeltjesfuik”</em>), being a social media environment of conspiracy theories (people are being offered such a huge amount of fake news, that eventually they start believing it). Additionally, <em>Verheyden</em> points to the impact of algorithms on social media like Facebook or Twitter since they create some kind of chamber in which you only get to see (fake) opinions that support your own view. “<em>What happened at the Capitol, is the sad peak of 4 years filled with disinformation, fake news, alternative facts and pure lies</em>”, he said. Also, important to note is that although the decision to suspend and delete Trump’s accounts was hard, it was in line with the terms of service of the social media platforms in question. <em>Verheyden</em> provides the example of Twitter and Facebook, whose terms of service clearly state that when someone incites hatred or violence, their account will be suspended. Nevertheless, it remains a difficult balancing exercise between the authority of platforms in this regard and the fundamental rights of people using them.</p>

    <p>Importantly, she remarks that social media serve a public function, yet are governed by private rules, which are set with a commercial goal in mind. She further states that the ‘influencing capacity’ of social media is not a bad thing per se: algorithms can also serve public goals. Polarising effects are accordingly not inherent in social media but designed into algorithms by humans. She further says that while freedom of expression is important, it may be limited. According to her, the question is therefore not whether the expression of opinions can be limited, but who is in charge of deciding whether limitations are justifiable. She also believes that polarisation in society is not just caused by one president or one particular algorithm. Nor does it result from naive social media users that are easy victims of psychographic micro-targeting. Instead, the fact that certain users can be manipulated shows that there are underlying factors in society that allow for this. Regulating algorithms may enable us to prevent the triggering of factors, however, it would not eliminate the underlying problem. Smuha believes that as long as we do not acknowledge that, national, European and even global regulations will not be able to offer solutions.</p>

    <p>In Finland high profile politicians commented on Trump's social media ban in the IS Puheenjohtajatentti 12 January 2021 (debate of party leaders due to forthcoming municipal election). Prime minister Marin found the deletion very problematic as a permanent measure. She found that there might be reasons for temporary measures to suspend an account in order to prevent violence, but she would prefer fact checking and twitter making warnings about the content. Similar views were expressed also by the chair of National Coalition Party Petteri Orpo, Center Party Annika Saarikko and True Finns Jussi Halla-aho. Overall tone was that social media giants have too much power. More acceptable for restriction was the Green Party Chair Maria Ohisalo.

Most of them focused on the protests that took place in the capitol and not on the ban of Donald Trump from Twitter. Those, examining the ban, underlined their observations about freedom of speech and the role of Social Media in Democracy.</p>

    <p>There was a debate about it, mainly because of the plans of the Hungarian government to regulate Facebook and social media. It was an important argument for the government to say that Facebook is censoring the conservative opinion. However, the critics of the government required more than just one sentence to deal with the case in light of its rough intervention, even though the communication of Trump crossed the boundaries of democratic communication already a long time ago.</p>

    <p>As expected, the suspensions and deletions of Trumps accounts attracted a lot of attention in our country and many people were to comment on it. The public was divided into two groups; those who considered this a reasonable decision in the light of Trumps conduct past months and others who believed that this limitation on freedom of expression went way too far. In reaching that conclusion considerable weight was put on the fact this was not a ban on certain unlawful content or a warning but rather a complete deletion similar to injection in advance on Trump´s expression.</p>

    <p>Of course, people realized that this was a special case and could not be given broader or more general meaning. These decisions however triggered a debate about the state of social media in general and their authority regarding limiting people´s expression.

There has been a discussion on the responsibility of individuals as regards their own comments on social media and as well whether responsibility can be established towards the social media companies as regards both unlawful expression (when the companies should be responsible for responding to offenses on behalf individuals) and where the limits lie as regards intervention on behalf of the companies in individuals expression.</p>

    <p>Trump’s removals from social networks attracted significant coverage in Ireland but relatively little political or media comment. There were no reported comments from Irish politicians, and most commentary in the Irish media was republished material from syndicated international columnists rather than by domestic writers. The only newspaper opinion piece directly discussing the removals was somewhat one-sided in being critical of the removal:</p>
<p>“<em>The corporate cancellation of the US president Donald Trump in the dying days of his regime is in large parts entertaining and satisfying  but also slightly worrying.

    <p>Political scientist and MEP Ivars Ijabs (Renew Europe) published an essay in which he sums up the facts and arguments of both sides (“The left-wing democratic flank argues, not without reason, that platforms should filter various extremist and racist content more vigorously. The Conservative wing, on the other hand, argues that platforms are given the right not to take responsibility for third-party content only on the condition that they maintain political neutrality and do not censor views that do not seem to be acceptable to their administration. And here begins the interesting part of the question: can a state oblige a platform to publish opinions which its management does not want to publish at all?

Where the “criticism” ends and “hatred” and “shouting” begin - there will always be a crypt of subjective perception.

    <p>Observer Aurimas Šimeliūnas doubts that it would be right to treat the ban of the President’s account on social media as merely a relationship between a private business entity and its client. In social networks business, clients create content which is essential for the meaning of social networks. Twitter tolerated Trump’s tweets for a long time and the fact that they banned him right before the end of his term as the President may indicate serving the interests of the social networks themselves rather than a genuine preoccupation with the future of democracy. Concluding his analysis, Šimeliūnas draws a parallel between excommunication from the church in Medieval times and the ban of accounts on social networks these days. Both measures work fast, both can be revoked upon repentance, in both cases court proceedings are not the main option and there is a possibility of following King Henry the VIII’s example of founding an alternative institution and becoming its head.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p><em>Aurimas Šimeliūnas</em>, Užblokuoti JAV prezidentą, 14/01/2021, https://www.bernardinai.lt/uzblokuoti-jav-prezidenta/?fb_comment_id=3704643762891703_3708106032545476.</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.bernardinai.lt/uzblokuoti-jav-prezidenta/?fb_comment_id=3704643762891703_3708106032545476' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

The public had an opportunity to ask questions and vote on the subject. Radzevičius stressed the importance of the contract between the social network and the user as well as of its terms. Trump is a user like any other user and, thus, can be suspended for failure to abide by these terms but whether this was justified in the particular case needs to be assessed, ultimately by a court of law. He also stressed that Facebook (and social networks generally) still chooses not to be treated as a traditional mass media and thus refuses full editorial responsibility for content posted on it. He also opined that court decisions on the matter adopted in the US and EU could be different as standards of the freedom of speech differ.</p>

Moreover, suspension of accounts is not effective as alternative accounts (networks, TV stations) can be created and the audience can easily migrate. Alternative networks can exacerbate the problem of divide and polarization of society.

She maintained that the suspension was part of a long-term plan of the social media platform providers to take on more responsibility with regard to what people say on their platforms, including democratically elected leaders.

    <p>In my opinion, regardless of their terms of use, social networks cannot arbitrarily suspend or delete users’ account, as it seriously interferes with freedom of expression. On the contrary, restrictions to freedom of expression have to be carried out in accordance with the principles laid down by international law, notably the ECHR, and national law, including relevant case-law, where the principle of proportionality plays a key role. In this context, social networks should care not only with indecency (pornography) but also with hate speech and fake news. Advocating genocide and other horrendous antihumanitarian actions are very serious criminal offences under national and international law, and social networks risk to be accomplices by inaction if they do not prevent the propagation of such hateful content.</p>

    <p>Just recently, YouTube deleted a video of a speech of Herbert Kickl, Member of the Austrian Parliament (FPÖ), which was originally posted on the YouTube channel of the FPÖ. In his speech, Kickl discussed different matters in regards to the Covid-19 crisis, especially related to vaccines. YouTube found the video contained fake news and not only deleted the video, but also temporarily blocked the YouTube channel of the FPÖ.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000123293259/zensurakt-youtube-loeschte-kickl-rede-im-parlament-wegen-fake-news</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000123293259/zensurakt-youtube-loeschte-kickl-rede-im-parlament-wegen-fake-news' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> (See also below, question 5)</p>

    <p>Last year, Facebook adapted its policy on images of “Zwarte Piet” (black Pete), an important character featured in the Belgian so-called “Sinterklaas” (Saint Nicholas) celebrations on the 6th of December. “Zwarte Piet” is black, not because he has a dark skin, but because he crawls down the chimney to deliver presents to young children on behalf of “Sinterklaas” - a white old man. Since 2013, when the UN asked the Dutch Government for clarifications concerning the celebrations and in particular Zwarte Piet’s stereotypical appearance as ‘Blackface’, it has been heavily debated whether or not “Zwarte Piet” is a racist tradition. In the context of these discussions, Facebook adapted its policy around “Zwarte Piet”, prohibiting images of the figure altogether, even retroactively. Months prior to the policy change, <em>Vlaams Belang</em> had published pictures of “Zwarte Piet”. Accordingly, Facebook required their erasure. Facebook threatened to take down their page, in case they would not delete them.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>A.

    <p>Even so, this is not a common occurrence in Norway. A more common “restriction” regularly imposed on Norwegian politicians is the “fact-check” services of various media houses, particularly during election campaigns. Most of these are not related to Facebook in any way, but there are exceptions. Faktisk.no has been part of Facebook’s cooperation “third-party-fact-checking” since 2018 and is also a member of the international fact checking network IFCN. Among other things, they have recently refuted the claim that the Government spends twice as much on external consultants as they do on the actual administration, and they have checked whether the Government actually did double the budget for transportation (depends on how one calculates).<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Faktisk.no@</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>There was no shutdown of Twitter accounts for politicians in Serbia, but in March 2020, the news that the social network Twitter shut down 8,558 Twitter accounts in Serbia caused great attention of the domestic and world public. The social network Twitter announced on its official "Twitter Safety" profile that their teams dealing with authentication deleted more than 8,500 accounts that were used to promote the ruling party in Serbia and its leader. It was a network of "bot" accounts that were engaged exclusively to promote the ruling party and its leader during the 2017 presidential election campaign, and then to bring down public support for the "1 in 5 million" protests, led by the opposition in Serbia, at the end of 2018.

    <p>Not directly. The only way this could come into play would be via the concept of Drittwirkung (“mittelbare Drittwirkung der Grundrechte”), meaning that social media platforms would have to consider freedom of expression when applying their code of conduct. However, there have not (yet) been any judicial decisions applying this concept in the context of social media platforms and their code of conduct in Austria. </p>

    <p>Absolutely yes. A public office holder is fully protected when acting as a private citizen. When performing official tasks, he/she may suffer restrictions or held accountable. This regime does not apply to Members of the Parliament who are covered by parliamentary prerogatives (Art. 68 of the Constitution). They cannot be held accountable for expressed votes and opinions <em>in the exercise of their functions as MPs.</em></p>

    <p>In a specific case the regime is different. The use of social network by public servants, and especially police and military personnel, could be ground for a disciplinary penalty if it sheds shadow over the honorability and impartiality of the official role vested. Released internal regulations limit the use of uniforms, the diffusion of sensible or confidential information, the expression of personal opinion, explicit sexual content and so on.</p>

Concerning the first criterion, the Ombudsman noted that, when examining Mr. Rasnačs (Minister of Justice at that time) Twitter profile, it could be seen that Rasnačs had positioned himself as Minister of Justice in the profile. The official website of the Ministry of Justice also included a link to the “Twitter account” of the Minister, synchronising Rasnačs latest entries. According to the content of the information published in the user’s account, it could be concluded that the Minister informs his followers about various important measures, amendments to regulatory enactments, news from the Ministry of Justice, as well as other institutions or activities of public importance. In view of the above, the Ombudsman concluded that Rasnačs Twitter user account was of a public nature, thus the Minister’s activity in expressing opinions on social networks and a person’s right to receive information from a user account had to be assessed in the context of Article 100 of the Satversme which guarantees freedom of expression (in this case - as the right of the reader).</p>

Their research showed that party leaders marked as political advertising twice as many posts on their public accounts than on their private accounts. A part of posts on private accounts could nevertheless be seen as political advertising. The study seems to imply that electoral campaign speech should be treated as being different from standard speech of a private individual.

Behaviour on social networks in Serbia is still not regulated by law, but by analogy with the norms on media freedom, it could be concluded that if any of the citizens, including the holder of a public office, used social networks in a way that violates a country’s positive legal regulations and abuses social networks to promote hatred or incite violence, they would not enjoy legal protection.

This “taking into account” includes a weighing of the user’s fundamental rights (e.g., freedom of expression) against the rights of the private platform (e.g., property rights). In this weighing the public position of the user can play a role, e.g., “that the claimant also needs his Twitter account for his political work.”<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>LG Dresden, 21.06.2019 - 1a O 1056/19 EV.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

<li>I do not consider that it is the role of the High Court to identify  in detail the criteria that must be applied by any broadcaster in  establishing threshold criteria of this type. The Court is inherently  unable to engage with those questions as the Court has no expertise in  the scheduling or producing of broadcasts…. </li>
<li>When positioning the provisions in particular of s. 114 of the Act  of 2009 in the constitutional framework one must also have regard to  Article 40.6.1 which recognises the role of the media as a “organ of  public opinion”, and that education of public opinion is a matter of  “grave import to the common good”. </li>
<li>I regard the provisions of Article 40.6.1(i) as importing a positive  obligation on a public service broadcaster to produce programmes and to  inform and educate. I consider that the framers of the constitution, in  recognising the unique and central role of the media, recognised both  its duty and any rights that flow therefrom. The right, it seems to me,  must include the right of editorial or programming choice, the right of  that organ of public opinion to choose the means by which it would  educate public opinion. The role thus understood and described as being  one of “grave import to the common good” recognises the singular nature  of the press and media, and what is singular and unique is found in the  editorial process. The Court is not an organ of public opinion, has no  expertise as such, and must respect the constitutionally different  factors at play in the media. </li>
<li>I do not consider that the High Court can have any role in that  editorial choice, and the choice is one that must be made by an expert  person or body who can weigh the elements of a programme by reference to  all of these factors, and presumably factors of which the Court could  have no knowledge.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>A similarly deferential view was taken in <em>Brandon Book Publishers v.

At least in certain cases social networks can be qualified as means of the provision of information to the public and be governed by the abovementioned law. In line with the requirements of this law, social networks would be obliged to comply with the prohibition to publish certain categories of information (e.g., hate speech). Regarding information which does not fall into the category of impermissible information (under Article 19), social networks would have some discretion in deciding what to publish. The discretion is, however, limited by a requirement for producers of disseminators of public information to ensure the diversity of opinions (Article 16) by publishing as many as possible opinions independent of each other. Moreover, a general right of the public to receive information should be considered.

    <p>In Norwegian law, the topic of a statement is considered more important for its level of protection than who actually said it (or wrote it, as the case may be).

    <p>When considering prosecution or investigations regarding expressions by MPs, it must accordingly be examined whether the impugned opinion was or was not expressed during their parliamentary duties.

    <p>Given the fact that there is no specific regulatory framework on that issue, it is a common belief that restrictions to the freedom of expression can be imposed only by law and with respect to the principles of the necessity and proportionality in a democratic society. However, regulating internet corresponds to a parallel responsibility on behalf of any body, institution and factor, both public and private, which should lead to the prevention (or restriction) of any illegal and harmful content. Certainly, defining the terms “illegal” and “harmful” is very difficult and include a subjective dimension. Nevertheless, I believe that depending on the facts of each case, platforms should play a decisive role on the promotion of democracy and the protection of fundamental rights in two ways: not only by abstaining from adopting any restrictive measure regarding the freedom of expression but also by adopting an explicit code of conduct and appropriate policy in order to ban the dissemination of disinformation and any illegal content.</p>

    <p>If content by a political actor violates the ToS <em>and</em> German law, it has to be removed. If it <em>only</em> violates the ToS, there is hardly a legal argument to force a platform to take the content down, even if its ToS says so. Rather, a user could make the case that a removal of his/her content due to ToS violates his/her freedom of expression and must remain online, as long as it does not inflict with German law. There are different legal opinions among the courts of appeal as to whether this is feasible or not, a final decision (by the Federal Supreme Court or even the Constitutional Court) has yet to be taken. Again, the weighing of the user’s rights against the platform’s rights can include the political role of the individual in question (see answer to question 5).</p>

    <p>Yes. Firstly, we have to consider, that the majority of young people get their information mainly by digital platforms. In addition, we have to take into account, that the existing digital platforms act as -de facto- monopoly in their field. Consequently, in my point of view, legal/regulatory initiatives over this field are essential in order to secure the freedom of speech and the direct communication between the political actors and the voters. As there is a regulatory framework for the operation of the public and private traditional media, that organizes, among others, the fair and equal promotion of political parties through media, we should also think of establishing a corresponding legal framework for the digital platforms.</p>

    <p>From a strictly legal perspective, it is dangerous for the social media platform to tolerate ambiguous or prima facie resentful content. Indeed, according to the Article 68 of the Italian Constitution, political representatives are immune from legal consequences regarding the expression of their ideas. It is arguable, that this privilege, though, is limited to members of Parliament and Regional assembly. It does not extend to lower-level politicians (i.e. members of council of municipality). Moreover, the fact that the author of illicit content cannot be criminally prosecuted as an individual, does not confer immunity to those who contributed to the circulation of the content. In other words, the platform could still be held responsible under the civil law, so potentially being subject to fines, penalties and restorations. The constitutional privilege saves only the politician.</p>

    <p>As far as we know there have been no cases on this topic yet. However, if we express our own opinion, the best option would be the one developed by Twitter – to keep the information online, however, with a cover-up, which points out its illegality and allows the users to choose whether they want to get acquitted with it. In such a way, society's interest in knowing what the politicians write (which would therefore allow individuals to make their political decisions) would be balanced with the need to delete the violating item. At the same time, such cover-ups should be limited to cases in which the specific speech only breaches the terms of service, but is not obviously illegal and dangerous, for example, by inciting to violence.</p>

  <p>How to make better rules: Some have suggested the creation of “platform councils” (advisory councils or quasi courts staffed by representative citizens or experts) to help platforms decide (like Facebook's Oversight Board).

Additionally, Facebook has created its Fact-checking program in Latvia, where the representatives of media (Delfi and Re:Baltica) proofread and rebuke presumably fake news. The involvement of local experts helps the social network to understand the content and context of the publication better.

It consists, inter alia, of persons nominated by the chamber of commerce, the catholic and protestant churches, and parties’ educational institutions (“Parteiakademien”). This council mainly serves as an advisory institution that provides recommendations to the Foundation Board, e.g. on content to be produced by the public broadcaster, quality assurance schemes, or the provision of content specifically tailored to the needs of persons with disabilities (“Angebot von Sendungen für gehörlose und gehörbehinderte Menschen”). Some of the Board’s decisions need confirmation of the Council, e.g. regarding broadcasting fees.

    <p>In this context, we refer to our answer to Question 2. As mentioned above, Facebook did impose content restrictions in respect of the account of a Belgian politician of <em>Vlaams Belang, Vandendriessche. Vandendriessche</em> heavily criticized the measures taken by the social network. As such, in the context of the restrictions imposed in relation to his post related to Samuel Paty, he said that “freedom of expression, the possibility to appeal against a decision [n the basis of which content is being restricte] and equal treatment (non-discrimination) are basic principles. Facebook violates all these basic principles when silencing a representative of the people, especially in case where fundamental democratic rights are defended against terrorism”. He demanded Facebook to lift the ban immediately and to review their policy, after which he argued that he would use “all legal and political means available to enforce his demands”.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p><em>Vlaams Belang</em>, “Alweer Facebook-pagina van Vlaams Belang geblokkeerd: “Censuur moet stoppen<em>”</em>“, <em>Vlaams Belang Nieuws</em>, October 18, 2020, <em>https://www.vlaamsbelang.org/alweer-facebook-pagina-van-vlaams-belang-geblokkeerd-censuur-moet-stoppen/</em>.</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.vlaamsbelang.org/alweer-facebook-pagina-van-vlaams-belang-geblokkeerd-censuur-moet-stoppen/*' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> According to <em>Vandendriessche</em>, <em>tech giants</em> are an outright threat to our democracy.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p><em>P.

    <p>Whereas criticism concerning the content restrictions experienced by (members of) <em>Vlaams</em> <em>Belang</em> was, until recently, only coming from within the party itself, it appears from the discussion in the plenary of the Flemish Parliament of 13 January 2021 (“freedom of expression and censorship on social media”, see Question 1) that, since the banning of Donald Trump from social media, such criticism is now coming from across the whole political spectrum. Accordingly, it seems as though there is a political momentum, at least in Flanders, to indeed denounce content restrictions by private entities imposed vis-à-vis political figures and holders of a public office.</p>

    <p>The ruling party’s relationship with Facebook and other platforms is highly controversial and fits well into the pattern of populist media policy. The ruling party uses social media most effectively to spread its own messages, it spends the most on Facebook ads, it maintains an organized troll army. An organization affiliated with the ruling party was formed last year with the goal of training influencers and social media communicators to support the ruling party. In parallel, as soon as the ruling party noticed that Facebook was taking global action against the hateful and lying content that the Hungarian ruling party's propaganda was also spreading in large numbers, the government immediately launched a communications attack against the platforms. Currently, the so-called Digital Freedom Committee is working on the preparation of the Hungarian Facebook Act.

    <p>Federico Costantini: It has to be considered that the Italian market of traditional mass media (press, Radio, TV) is very fragmented. The fact that there are so many operators at regional and local level creates a very hard competition. As far as I can see, operators tend to avoid conflicts in order to maintain the status quo, which is based on personal relations (among journalists / institutional press offices / press agencies / PR agencies and so on). It is very unlikely that an internet company could “censor” a politician, fearing that this could lead to a loss of advertisers. However, is more plausible that it could censor its critics. The idea is that “follow the money” works as a golden rule even in this field.</p>

    <p>The simple legal answer is that the rules would be followed. The starting point would be the terms of service provided by the platform. If the holder of a public office was in breach of them, it must be assessed what the correct reaction should be, as laid out in the terms of service. An overreaction (permanent deletion of all content and blocked for life in response to a minor ## infraction) would most likely be checked by § 36 of the Contracts Act (Avtaleloven), which states that unreasonable contracts may be rescinded or amended in whole or in part. The unreasonableness must be qualified, but excessive reactions would most likely meet the criteria. Reactions which appear proportionate to the infraction would be accepted by the courts, although considering ECHR art. 10 and § 100 of our Constitution, it would most likely take a considerable infraction to accept permanent denial of service, as holders of public offices are wanted participants in the public debate.</p>

    <p>The practice on social networks is the rare cancellation of profiles and a complete ban, but mostly a ban on a certain post with the explanation that it contains false information<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/svet-55188333</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/svet-55188333' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>. However, it is very difficult to understand who and in what way determines what false information is. Thus, such a practice is almost tantamount to a total ban, if posts posted by a particular person are banned.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>On the professional network, LinkedIn, for example, the deletion of the profile of a person who was very active and popular on those networks, with somewhat harsh comments on posts, is currently taking place. This is where the discussion started about how much freedom of speech is really endangered. Can the cause be found in human nature itself, where freedoms and opposing views are generally supported, but when the discussion descends to a personal level or a level we are not personally up to, then we even initiate and support prohibitions ourselves.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/milisav-lekovic-47423126_danas-on-sutra-ti-ili-ja-pitanje-je-dana-ugcPost-6774798815061958656-sh_3</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.linkedin.com/posts/milisav-lekovic-47423126_danas-on-sutra-ti-ili-ja-pitanje-je-dana-ugcPost-6774798815061958656-sh_3' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The Working Papers of the <a href="https://gdhrnet.eu/">Global Digital Human Rights Network</a> – edited by Mart Susi and Matthias C. Kettemann – addresses both idealistic as well as practice-oriented dimensions of the field. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series attempts to reverse this pattern and with the Network’s capability looks to to break or at least question the strengthening grip of the online companies as powerful actors in defining the image of human rights in the digital landscape.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19143/">GDHRNet COST Action</a> will systematically explore the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of human rights. The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility. </p>

    <p>The Action will propose a comprehensive system of human rights protection online, in the form of recommendations of the content assessment obligation by online companies, directed to the companies themselves, European and international policy organs, governments and the general public. The Action will also develop a model which minimizes the risk of arbitrary assessment of online content and instead solidifies standards which are used during content assessment; and maximizes the transparency of the outcome. </p>

    <p>Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and collaborate. All the information can be found in the booklet <a href="https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-cost/coronavirus-covid- 19">“COST Actions against COVID-19 – An interdisciplinary network” </a>.</p>
