      <p>This study, the fourth in a series conducted within the Global Digital Human Rights Network, focuses on the changes in (social) media governance after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. This study analyses how 29 states, including 18 EU members, have dealt with governing information flows related to the informational dimension of Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Based on questions answered by country rapporteurs, and analysis by a team of editors, this study shows a common approach by EU member states after the EU’s ban on Russian state-sponsored media. Non-EU-states tend to have a less vigorous response to Russian state-sponsored media.</p>
<p>Importantly, the country rapporteur surveyed indicate that conflicts are not usually the best times to formulate new normative approaches. With any rules that limit the free flow of information, however, legality, legitimacy, and proportionality of the restriction must be carefully analysed.</p>

    <p>In times of crisis, concerns over war propaganda and the spread of disinformation rub against the need to protect our fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy. The war in Ukraine, and the ensuing geopolitical crisis that is emerging in the wake of this conflict, calls upon the international scholarly community but also on human rights activists and legislators to reconsider the relationship between freedom of expression, the right to privacy and the need for public safety and the protection of national security. When re-conceptualizing the relationship between fundamental rights and security, we are mindful that neither freedom of expression nor the right to privacy are absolute rights. The relative weight of these conflicting rights and interests may need further differentiation. Concerns over incitement to hatred and the justification of war crimes require adequate responses from states, media organisations, and social media platforms. This new and important study documents and analyses the responses of states, media organisations and social media platforms to the war in Ukraine. Governing Information Flows during War: A Comparative Study of Content Governance and Media Policy Responses after Russia's Attack on Ukraine makes a key contribution to this pressing debate on disinformation and war propaganda, and to the role of fundamental human rights in the digital age. I would like to recognise all country rapporteurs who have contributed to the quick compilation of data and expression of views on these significant matters.</p>

<li>In regard to the collection of data on armed conflicts, private actors can also play an important role. Social media platforms have a legitimate interest to delete war-related information that displays, inter alia, illegitimate content such as hostilities, violence and wounded persons, but also disinformation. However, providers should also be aware that they sometimes provide the only easily accessible possibility for those affected by armed conflict to store proof of possible human rights violations, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Platforms should hence provide special procedures to restore such deleted data, and/or collaborate directly with prosecutors of international and national investigators and courts.</li>

    <p>Out of the 27 EU member countries, we obtained information from 18 – Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden – and it appears that large private media outlets acted quickly on their own initiative and suspended the distribution of Russian news channels in only one country – Finland. There are examples that some companies in Austria and Latvia took similar action, but the scale was smaller. In five countries – Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the national authorities issued instructions to suspend Russian media outlets shortly after the invasion, hence prior to the Council Regulation and even before the President of the European Commission announced the intention to implement this measure across the EU. Given the shortness of the “time window” in Europe, it would be overly formal to give too much significance to the question “Who acted first?” – private media companies or national governments. What matters is that access to certain Russian and Belarussian media outlets was suspended within a very short period as a result of coordinated activity between the national authorities and private actors. There are no reports of non-compliance with the respective state instructions. All other EU countries surveyed took action only after the Council Regulation by implementing its provisions. We can add the United Kingdom to this list, although no longer a member of the EU, as it exhibited a similar pattern. It would be speculative to contemplate if, when and how governments of EU Member States would have acted, had there been no immediate response from the EU Commission. We surveyed 11 non-EU countries: Albania, Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Israel, Moldova, Norway, Serbia, South Africa, Turkey. None of these countries report state intervention into access to Russian and Belarussian media outlets, nor any restrictive measures introduced by social media companies on their own initiative.</p>

    <p>The “time window” in Europe was relatively short for private media companies to take action upon their own initiative to restrict or block access to Russian and Belarussian media outlets, and for the national authorities in the EU countries to issue such instructions. The timeframe is from early morning on 24 February 2022 – when Russia invaded Ukraine – until 1 March 2022, when the Council of Europe adopted Regulation (EU) 2022/350, which is directly applicable in its entirety and suspended broadcasts from and access to certain Russian media outlets. In reference to this timeframe of only five days we have studied whether there was any action taken before the Regulation by private media companies and/or national governments on their own initiative to reach the same effect.</p>

    <p>There is only one EU member country among the countries surveyed where private entities acted on their own initiative before the national government instructions and the Council Regulation. This country is <strong>Finland</strong>. Action was taken by the big network companies themselves very quickly. This includes two main corporations that distribute Russian news channels. Elisa corporation announced on Friday 25 February on its Twitter account (@ElisaOyj) that they support Ukraine and are suspending the broadcasting of the Channel Russia Today. The same happened with Telia Finland, which announced on 25 February on their twitter account (@teliafinland) that they would stop freely transmitting Russian news channels Russia Today and RU-TV because of the war in Ukraine. With some reservations <strong>Austria</strong> and <strong>Latvia</strong> can be added to this list. Magenta Austria, owned by Deutsche Telekom, preempted the EU legislation and blocked RT on 27 February 2022. In Latvia, several operators had already stopped the distribution of some Russian channels on 1 February 2022 before the beginning of the war. The intention of these actions is unknown, presumably it was due to a lack of consumer interest. The chairman of the National Electronic Mass Media Council (NEPLP) noted that this decision would reduce the amount of propaganda. </p>

    <p>On 9 March 2022, the CPTRA issued another instruction stopping access to the Russian TV program RBK (also known as RBC TV). The text of this instruction is published in writing on 11 pages and signed by the lawyer of the information society office. The instruction provides detailed excerpts from the program on 3 March – for example Ukrainian soldiers are named as murderers, it is argued that Ukraine was not supposed to have weapons threatening Russia, and it is suggested that the decision to invade had been justified, even obligatory. The instruction refers to the Estonian media services act as its legal basis, which prohibits the transmission of programs inciting violence and hatred, when this causes damage to someone’s life, health or property. The instruction says that by labelling the Ukrainian population as fascist and murderous, it is indirectly inciting violence against the Ukrainian state and people. The instruction provides a remedy to bring a claim in front of the CPTRA or Tallinn Administrative Court. It is stated that the claim does not suspend the applicability of the instruction.</p>

    <p>In <strong>Latvia</strong>, on 24 February 2022, the NEPLP suspended the retransmission of several Russian channels, but on 25 February 2022, one of the leading television providers – tet – decided to stop the retransmission of television channels on all of the company's television platforms, the owners or officials of which are affiliated with the Government of the Russian Federation, subject to international sanctions or whose status is currently not fully obtainable. The decision came into force immediately, and on the night of Saturday, 26 February 2022, the retransmission was suspended for the following channels: PBK Estonia, MirTV, THT, Пятница International, THT4 International, CTC Baltics, RTVi, THT Music, КХЛ, Авто Плюс, Наука, Перец !, РБК, 1 + 2, Моя Планета, and Домашний. A similar decision was taken by television platform “Go3", satellite television “Home3” and the telecommunications company SIA “Baltcom”. It must be noted that at the time of the decision, both "TV3 Group" and "Baltcom" decided to suspend not only channels whose retransmission licences were revoked by the NEPLP, namely, PBK Lietuva and PBK, but also all other channels produced in Russia. Therefore, the NEPLP and private companies worked <em>side by side</em> – NEPLP revoking the retransmission licences on the basis of a proven discrepancy with the law, but the private actors taking more cautious steps, meaning even more comprehensive bans.</p>

    <p>Telenet, one of the biggest media services distributors and the only one offering Russia Today in <strong>Belgium</strong>, stopped the distribution of Russia Today around 28 February. This decision was not taken on its own initiative, it was asked to do so by the Conference of Telecommunications and Media Regulators (CRC). The CRC consists of the Flemish Media Regulator <a href="https://www.vlaamseregulatormedia.be/en"><em>VRM</em></a>, the Media Regulator of the French-speaking Community <a href="http://www.csa.be/"><em>CSA</em></a>, the Media Regulator of the German-speaking Community <em>Medienrat</em> and the federal telecommunications regulator <a href="https://www.bipt.be/operators/media-regulator"><em>BIPT</em></a>. In the Flemish press it was reported that in the run-up to this decision the Flemish Minister of Media sent a letter to the Flemish Media Regulator requesting them to decide to stop the broadcasting of Russia Today. However, Flemish press reported that Russia Today could still be accessed (in Flanders) after the distribution by Telenet was suspended, for instance through Rumble. In that same newspaper article it is reported that the Belgian internet providers Proximus, Telenet and Voo were blocking a number of websites on which RT was available. In a statement issued by the CSA on 2 March, a reference had been made to the fact that they were looking into whether domains offering Russia Today and Sputnik could be suspended. </p>

    <p>For <strong>Moldova</strong> it should be noted that several influential legacy media outlets, who in the past retransmitted Russian state media, have ceased to do so since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, anticipating a ban from the national regulator. The cessation to rebroadcast was accompanied by an increase of locally created content that could not be banned by national regulator, in the framework of a national ban that would mimic the one imposed at the EU level. This tactic has enabled these legacy media outlets to circumvent a ban on activity and continue to spread disinformation. There was no noteworthy access blocking on social media.</p>

    <p>In <strong>Serbia,</strong> the Ministry of Culture and Information, which is in charge of the media, has not declared its official stance regarding the European sanctions against Russia Today and Sputnik and how they will affect Serbia. The media house “Sputnik Srbija” has its correspondent office in Belgrade and news in the Serbian language, with constantly updated information about the situation in Ukraine. Cable operators in Serbia broadcast the Russia Today channel in English until the broadcast of Russia Today and Sputnik on the Eutelsat 16A satellite was stopped on March 2, 2022, due to the decision of the Council of the European Union when the signal from the satellite was turned off. After that, on March 5, the state operator Telekom Srbija (MTS, Supernova) re-established the broadcasting of the content of the Russia Today channel, and Orion Telekom did the same a day later on its IPTV and OTT platform. The state operator Telekom Srbija broadcasts the Russia Today channel on the IPTV platform as well as on the Supernova cable network, while the channel is still not available on the OTT (Iris TV Go, Supernova TV) and satellite platform (m: SAT TV).

    <p>The <strong>South African</strong> position has gone against the grain of most countries in the world. The only case of access being blocked is that RT has been taken off the DSTV menu. The DSTV has stated that they have not blocked access to RT themselves, but rather it is their global service provider that has blocked RT. It reads “Feed Stopped Abruptly by Supplier” with an explainer, “The feed for this channel is not available from the international supplier. We apologise that the broadcast feed was abruptly stopped”. Journalist’s responses to the banning of RT have typically been negative, and along the lines of the ban being “a dangerous moment for journalism”. It’s important to point out that while RT has been blocked on DSTV, it is still available on YouTube to the South African public.</p>

    <p>Most EU MS’s responses (see e.g., submissions from <strong>Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden</strong>) were confined to the transposition of the sanctions imposed against Russia at the supranational level.

    <p>Authorities in <strong>Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania</strong> as well as <strong>Poland</strong> acted quickly and on their own account, banning a number of Russian (and Belarussian) broadcasting services since the beginning of the invasion – hence before the EU sanctions were enacted. In the case of Latvia, restrictions were imposed even earlier: 60 programs – half of which were Russian – were banned from broadcasting in the past three years. In these states, regulatory agencies have taken an especially active role - bans, based on the applicable provisions of national law, came directly from them (see <strong>Estonia, Lithuania</strong>). The quality of legal arguments therein varies. The majority of non-EU states have not imposed any sanctions at all. The <strong>United Kingdom</strong> stands out: The media regulator Ofcom opened 27 investigations into RT, and the UK’s public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), has halted all content licensing with its Russian customers.</p>

    <p>Aside from the rather mundane finding that EU MS abided by the sanctions introduced by the Union, one can identify a correlation between actions taken by countries and their geographical, cultural, and linguistic proximity to Russia. The higher this proximity to the Russian Federation, the more expedient and far-reaching are responses from regulatory agencies. This is especially displayed by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, whose authorities banned a wide span of Russian broadcasting services and websites. These restrictions were all argued very similarly in the interest of national security.</p>

    <p>Another deduction can be made concerning the relative inaction of some states in the Balkans which seem to display conflicting interests and allegiances. For example, <strong>Serbia</strong> is hopeful of becoming an EU MS on the one hand, but on the other hand there are historical ties to the Russian Federation. By not imposing any sanctions, Serbia neither conforms to the EU sanctions regime, nor explicitly expresses its loyalty to Russia. The situation of <strong>Albania</strong> and <strong>Bosnia and Herzegovina</strong> is similar. In <strong>Moldova</strong>, among other states, while there are regulations in place banning programs that originate in states that have not ratified the European Convention on Transboundary Television, including the Russian Federation, it is still possible to watch Russian TV channels via satellite or online.</p>

    <p>While there are no social-media-specific coordination procedures or regulations in our sample countries, there are more general emergency powers of government that relate to the media in times of crisis. These possibilities for restrictions generally cover public interests, such as national security. None of these laws, however, has been used to (attempt to) regulate social media platforms during the present armed conflict. Where there has been government coordination with platforms, as in Latvia, it occurred via ad hoc agreements. One more social-media-specific law that is relevant in the present crisis, the French law against the manipulation of information, is in fact not applied, but overridden by EU legislation, which, in turn, is currently being challenged at the European Court of Justice by RT France. Legislative procedures underway, such as the UK’s Online Safety Bill or a similar law in Israel, could profit from taking into account these aforementioned legal proceedings in France. Most importantly, lawmakers should specifically bear in mind the dual publication channels used by classical media (own platform/social media accounts) and include the social media pages of these media as well as a coordination mechanism with social media platforms for governments. The submission from Cyprus specifically mentions an urgent need for regulation in this regard.</p>

    <p>Besides the legislative capabilities needed to create functioning laws, administrative capabilities are – obviously – necessary to implement these regulations, as is also the willingness of platforms to coordinate them. Another reason for a lack of coordination, as indicated by Moldova, is the small size of some national social media markets. In some states, including South Africa, the demands of a state of crisis cause the competent authorities to become over-stretched.</p>

    <p>What we can find in the reports by many of the surveyed countries is that they think the current regulations are not sufficient and not up to date. The Analysis of Irish discourses on the topic reveals that the law essentially regulates traditional broadcast media only; it has not been updated to address specific information or misinformation on websites and social media. In Argentina, current regulations are described as inaccurate. Albania also has the same problem: “Another worrying problem, which has recently become the focus of debate on the legislation on freedom of expression and information, is also the lack of legal reflection on the technological developments in the field of information. Current media legislation refers only to traditional media (with the exception of information platforms on the Internet mentioned in the Law on Audiovisual Media only in relation to the technical side of their licensing).”</p>

    <p>Researchers in South Africa also claim that their national laws were currently insufficient to take action on media corporations for mis-and disinformation. Latvian scholars have claimed that they have noticed substantial Russian disinformation, especially in the Russian speaking minority in their country. “In the last two weeks, both the NEPLP (National Electronic Mass Media Council) and the Parliament as well as private parties have been actively working to limit the possibilities for disinformation and access to propaganda TV channels and webpages spreading disinformation.” The United Kingdom is introducing an Online Safety Bill, which will regulate social media platforms and give enhanced powers to the UK media regulator Ofcom. Serbia has the strictest regulation for fake news and disinformation (“causing panic and disorder by presenting or spreading false news or allegations”) as it is part of the Criminal code of the Republic of Serbia and includes a penalty at the basic level of imprisonment for 3 months to 3 years. The criminal legislation of Serbia is applied equally in regular circumstances, as well as in a state of emergency.</p>

    <p>It seems that there is a wide consensus that bans on Russian/associated media are necessary.

<li><strong>Norm and standard building.</strong> The respondents have indicated that norms are best made during peaceful times. There may be a need for more specific disinformation regulation and the outcome of the DSA trilogue may shift towards greater restrictions, although governing disinformation remains very hard and often clashes with specific consitutional guarantees for freedom of expression. The war will probably cause more safeguards to be developed to ensure access to the internet (developing infrastructure including the so-called alternative internet). There is an absence or a lack of objective criteria (and clear procedures for implementing them) for such a ban. At times, it may well prove necessary to suppress clear cases of mis/disinformation that cause direct harm to society (e.g., such as during a public health or international security crisis) but this should be carefully considered and a measured approach should be adopted to avoid setting unfortuante precedents. Banning social media, channels and pages interferes with freedom of expression.

    <p>There has not been any significant increase of incitement to hatred towards ethnic minorities due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In some countries politicians have addressed that there should not be attacks against the Russian population and Russian aggression should not be blamed on Russian individuals. Intelligence agencies have warned about Russia using this argumentation as a justification for further aggression, and therefore reminded the public that individual Russians are not to be blamed for the actions taken by the Russian government.</p>

    <p>There seems to be no major signs of any systematic incitement of hate towards ethnic minorities due to the war in Ukraine. However, in some countries, key political leaders have addressed this issue and requested that no hatred be expressed towards Russian individuals staying in their country.</p>

    <p>There are dangerous signs that Russia uses hatred towards ethnic minorities to build a false narrative in their own state propaganda and as justification for further aggression. Intelligence agencies have warned about this strategy and reminded us that ordinary individuals with a Russian background are not responsible for the invasion. Russian embassies in some countries have used social media (Twitter) to distribute the message that they want to collect information about aggression towards Russian citizens or the Russian-speaking population. This has received strong opposition from the local Russian-speaking population.</p>

<li>Media governance has changed substantially after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. A digital Iron Curtain was put up, as social media companies withdrew or were banned in Russia and Russian state-sponsored news outlets were the targets of EU sanctions and deplatforming. This study analyses how 29 states, including 18 EU members, have dealt with the media governance questions related to the informational dimension of Russia’s war on Ukraine.</li>

    <ul>
<li>It appears that in only one country – Finland – did large private media outlets act quickly on their own initiative after the start of the military aggression against Ukraine to suspend the distribution of Russian news channels. There are examples that some companies in Austria and Latvia took similar actions, but the scale is smaller. In five countries – Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the national authorities issued instructions to suspend Russian media outlets shortly after the invasion, prior to the 1 March 2022 Council Regulation 2022/350 and even before the President of the European Commission announced on 27 February 2022 the intention to implement such a measure across the EU. Given the shortness of this “time window” it would be overly formal to give too much meaning to the question “Who acted first?” – private media companies or national governments. What matters is that access to certain Russian and Belarussian media outlets was suspended within a very short period as a result of coordinated activity between national authorities and private actors. There are no reports of non-compliance with the respective state instructions.</li>

<li>Most EU Member State responses were confined to the transposition of the sanctions imposed against Russia at the supranational level, including the ban on Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, without taking further, more wide-ranging action. The transposition of Council Regulation 2022/350 was typically accompanied by communications by the respective regulatory agencies in EU Member States to media companies and internet providers on their new duties emanating from the sanctions. Hence, the role of regulatory agencies was mostly confined to informing norm addressees of the new European legislation.</li>

<li>The majority of non-EU states (in our survey Albania, Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Iceland, Israel, Moldova, Norway, Serbia, South Africa, and Turkey) have not imposed any sanctions at all. Outside the EU, the United Kingdom stands out: the media regulator Ofcom opened 27 investigations against RT, and the UK’s public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), halted all content licensing with its Russian customers. In contrast, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina chose to rely on general liability regulations for spreading disinformation and not conforming with the journalistic principles of objective information and transparency.</li>

    <ul>
<li>Most governments did not propose or introduce domestic legislation aimed at regulating platforms, social media accounts or TV channels in response to the war in Ukraine. A small number of states located within geographical proximity to Russia or Belarus introduced legislative changes; for example, via amendments to existing laws, such as Estonia and Latvia; by introducing a state of emergency that extends to the control of broadcasting and social media, such as Lithuania; or by conferring additional powers on security agencies to monitor the media coverage of the war, such as Moldova.</li>

<li>In addition, several governments asked their respective national regulators to ban or block access to Russian TV stations. For example, in Belgium, the Flemish (regional) parliament asked the government to take all possible measures against Russian disinformation, and to advocate for a stronger EU-wide framework against disinformation.</li>

<li>The participants in the study were asked about the position of their national governments on the EU-wide ban on Russia and Russian-associated media. Basically, two major currents can be identified: the supporters of the ban and the neutral countries/abstainers. Public debates are restrained. If there is criticism, it is more abstract and focused on the importance of free media and information rights.</li>

<li>None of the participating states have specific procedures in place regarding the regulation of social media corporations during times of crisis. There are, however, legal possibilities to regulate the media in general in the interest of national security (e.g., as used in Albania, Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Norway, Turkey, and the case of the UK’s Online Safety Bill). These procedures mainly apply to specific content and/or situations, such as hate speech, data protection (Albania) or disinformation during elections (France) rather than times of crisis (i.e., the present armed conflict) as such. Latvia, while not having any specific procedures for times of crisis in place, managed to enter into an ad hoc agreement with YouTube to block forbidden channels and prohibited TV broadcasts (RT) via its national regulatory agency (NEPLP).</li>

<li>There seems to be wide consensus among elected officials that bans of Russian/associated media have been appropriate and necessary. In a small number of countries representatives of opposition parties have been critical of these bans. Officials in the countries outside of the EU which have not introduced bans of Russian/associated media have based this approach on the neutrality argumentation.</li>

    <p>The Working Papers of the <a href="https://gdhrnet.eu/">Global Digital Human Rights Network</a> – edited by Mart Susi and Matthias C. Kettemann – addresses both idealistic as well as practice-oriented dimensions of the field. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series questions this approach and, through empirical studies and dogmatic analysis, provide best practice models for the protection of human rights in times of powerful private actors and digital challenges to individual freedoms and social cohesion.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19143/">GDHRNet COST Action</a> will systematically explore the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of human rights. The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility. </p>

    <p>Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and collaborate.
