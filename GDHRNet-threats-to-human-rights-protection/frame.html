      <p>Digital technologies come with both widespread benefits and potential threats to people and communities across the globe. It is important to be aware of the threats in order to fully harness the positive potential of digital technologies. This report hopes to contribute to this goal. It is a compilation of contributions from twenty-two researchers from the Global Digital Human Rights Network. The report highlights some core problems that can arise in the digital realm. The report is divided into five parts: (a) overarching issues that impact human rights in general, (b) threats that are connected to technology/technological advancements, (c) threats connected to disinformation, (d) threats connected to privacy and freedom of expression, and (e) threats in relation to vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>The amplitude of different threats makes it essential that these technologies are reined in by effective regulation based on international human rights law and standards. The initiatives taken on both regional and global levels are noted in this report in relation to each threat that is addressed. Each report section concludes with recommendations for policies and activities that are aimed at minimising threats to human rights protection from the digital environment.</p>

    <p>Digital technologies are bringing widespread benefits to people and communities across the globe.

E.g., AI-aided technologies have helped diagnose diseases and save lives (helping ensure the right to health) and virtual learning has provided access to education to a multitude of students who would otherwise be excluded. However, digital technologies can also bring with them a multitude of problems and potential threats to human rights protection, especially if they are misused or the necessary protective actions are not taken. There is a pressing need for adequate protection by governments (vertical approach) and online stakeholders (horizontal approach). As technological developments take place faster than regulation than can catch up, the guidelines and rules that have been adopted have not provided solutions to many of the issues, including the human rights’ implications of digital activities.</p>

    <p>The most recent UN Human Rights Council report on the right to privacy in the digital age engages with numerous threats to privacy and highlights how digital tools can expose people to new forms of monitoring, profiling and control. It focuses on three trends in state actions in relation to the right to privacy: ‘(a) the widespread abuse of intrusive hacking tools; (b) the key role of robust encryption in ensuring the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other rights; and (c) the widespread monitoring of public spaces. The report highlights the very real and encroaching risk of creating systems of pervasive surveillance and control that may eventually choke the development of vibrant, prosperous and rights-respecting societies’.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>UN Human Rights Council, ‘The right to privacy in the digital age: Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’, UN Doc.

    <p>There are also threats that can lead to increased discrimination. For example, AI and algorithms can replicate or even amplify human and systemic bias, if they are based on data that is lacking diversity. This may be amplified by a general lack of diversity in the technology sector. Additionally, not everyone has the same opportunity to benefit from digital technology. Often it is women, the elderly or other vulnerable groups that remain disconnected, or, if they have access to internet, it may be less meaningful due to lack of digital skills.</p>

    <p>While the Internet offers numerous possibilities for exercising human rights, it also has certain features which make it a source of risk and threats for human rights. Some of these threats manifest themselves only in very specific contexts, whereas others are of a general and overarching nature.</p>

    <p>Some of those general threats are of a legal nature as they stem from uncertainty, limited scope, or divergent interpretations of law. Such is a threat of social platforms evading responsibility for human rights violations as under constitutional law of many jurisdictions they are not considered to be human rights bearers. Another threat of a similar nature is the uncertainty of whether another category of private actors, namely, investors, are bound by human rights standards when they are involved in activities in the digital realm.</p>

    <p>Some other threats are legal in a sense that they could be addressed by legal means, but legal standards are not yet developed because the phenomenon causing a human rights problem is not yet understood to a sufficient extent. Such is a threat of cancel culture and social engineering in the context of elections where the harm of manipulated voting is obvious but how exactly the prohibited acts should be defined or how they could be prevented is an open question. Similarly, a question to what extent the risk of addiction to the Internet could provide entitlements to health care services or lead to limitations of online time is linked to a question whether mental health research provides sufficient basis for any such conclusion.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, there is also a problem of the insufficiency of the legal approach to tackling digital human rights issues. Not only is there a need for concrete evidence to shape a legal response to Internet-related human rights threats, but also there is the inherently multidimensional nature of compliance with human rights in the digital realm, which requires a multidimensional response, including in the context of awareness raising and training. Law should be complemented by ethics and the training on cyber ethics should be provided along with training on digital human rights law.</p>

    <p>It is a common understanding that social platforms affect internet users’ human rights. Online intermediaries routinely interfere with users’ right to privacy, freedom of speech, the right not be discriminated and intellectual property rights, to name just the most vulnerable. They enjoy practically unchecked power to collect private data, block, filter, censor, manipulate, or expose vulnerable groups, particularly children, to contents that can have a dangerous impact on their mental or even physical health and development.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>For more see Nicola Lucchi, “Internet Content Governance and Human Rights”, 16 <em>Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment and Technology Law</em> 809, 2014.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The current tendency to protect human rights in the digital sphere is reflected in states’ efforts to control social platforms through administrative and legislative regulations, international soft-law instruments applicable to transnational corporations, such as UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and social platforms’ self-regulations. For example, Facebook defines binding policies, norms, and standards of behavior that users must follow when participating in the Facebook community. It also enforces these policies, meaning that Facebook regulates and adjudicates conflicts between itself and its users or between users themselves.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>For more see Moran Yemini, “Missing in ‘State Action’: Toward A Pluralist Conception of The First Amendment”, 23 <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review</em> 1149, 2020.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> In Busch’s view, Facebook amounted to an almost state-like institution in itself, with many of the major characteristics of a developed political system.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Thorsten Busch, Fair Information Technologies: The Corporate Responsibility of Online Social Networks as Public Regulators 71 (2013) (unpublished dissertation) (on file with the University of St. Gallen), https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/228863</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/228863' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> Consequently, social platforms exercise a power akin to state power which represents the specific challenge for constitutional democracies. </p>

    <p>However, while a state faces constitutional responsibility for human rights violations, social platforms in most jurisdictions still evade this responsibility. This is because the law generally regards the state as the primary, if not sole, bearer of duties correlative with rights.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>See Violeta Beširević, “Uhvati me ako možeš”: o (ne)odgovornosti transnacionalnih korporacija zbog kršenja ljudskih prava [ “Catch Me If You Can”: Reflections on Legal (Un)Accountability of Transnational Corporations for Human Rights Violations],<em> Pravni zapisi</em>, (2018), no.1, pp.21-42.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> Rights do not regulate the relations between private parties whose autonomy should stay free from the compulsory regime created by the constitutions. In other words, constitutional rights apply only in relations between the government and an individual (vertically) but not between private parties (horizontally). Although the constitution generally does not sanction private deprivations of constitutional rights in most jurisdictions, notable exceptions do exist. The horizontal effect of human rights, either direct or indirect, has been recognized in several jurisdictions, most notably Ireland, South Africa, Germany, Canada, the European Union, and several Latin American states. The emerging trend, although still sporadic, is its application in digital sphere.</p>

    <p>The European Union, a transnational political entity of a constitutional nature, is at the forefront of addressing the responsibility of social platforms for human rights violations in the digital surrounding. First, the EU will soon adopt the Digital Services Package, composed of the Digital Market Act and the Digital Service Act, which should be operable across the EU from 1 January 2024 the lattes.

    <p>Regarding national jurisdictions, Germany took an especially proactive approach, partially thanks to the judge-made <em>Drittwirkung</em> doctrine, established in 1958. Broadly speaking, the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) ruled that the constitutional values embedded, for example, in human rights, do not only oblige the state but private parties as well, meaning that fundamental rights have an indirect horizontal effect on the relations between private parties. In 2019, the FCC, although not in a firm voice, extended the application of the <em>Drittwirkung</em> doctrine to the digital realm. Referring to social networks and assessing their rising powers, in<em> obiter</em> <em>dictum</em>, the FCC established that "the biding effects of fundamental right on private actors can ultimately be close, or even equal to its binding effect on the state."<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>See FCC Order, 6 November 2019, -No.1 BvR 16/13 (Right to be forgotten I), para.88.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> However, starting from the <em>Drittwirkung</em> doctrine, the Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) recently concluded that Facebook is not big enough to be in the state’s position and that, consequently, constitutional rights do not limit its activities.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>See FCJ, III ZR 179/20 and III ZR 192/20  from July 29, 20221.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> Yet, important footnote should be added here. Although the Court found that Facebook enjoys certain rights in the digital sphere, including freedom of expression and the right to conduct business, the FCJ held that it could not regulate users’ actions without considering their rights. Put differently, Facebook can develop its own rules and enforce them, but not without respecting procedural requirements (similar to a state), including informing users about its actions before and after their enforcement and respecting their right to redress.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>For more see Matthias C.

    <p>In sharp contrast to this view stands a firm understanding of the US Supreme Court that constitutional rights are shields only against the state. Under its state action doctrine, the US Constitution applies only to governmental conduct and does not extend to the behavior of private parties. Those who benefit the most from this approach are online platforms. Based on the state action doctrine, the US courts have repeatedly rejected free-speech-related claims against social platforms.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Yemini, <em>supra note</em> 12, p.1168.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The concept "culture of cancellation", “cancel culture” or “call out culture” refers to the act of socially “canceling” a person, a form of involuntary ostracism caused by others’ actions, aimed to invalidate the victims’ opinions and virtually their existence in all areas of society. Even though those actions could or not take place in the cyberspace, specialized literature usually refers to this phenomenon within the framework of social networks (such as posting – true of false – comments about socially reprehensible conduct, such as child abuse or gender violence). Obviously, cancel culture is a major problem when it is illegitimately used, and in certain circumstances can affect the foundations of democracy, for example spreading false accusations directed against other candidates in an election process.</p>

    <p>Through social engineering techniques, an action could perfectly be generated towards the social cancellation of someone who has not committed any wrongdoing. This could occur, for example, through the use of artificial intelligence and information from social networks to generate a smear campaign through fake news regarding a certain person who can present himself as a rival to be defeated by a politician in an electoral contest (for example, these kinds of techniques were used during the 2016 election of the United States president, which was discovered due to the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal).</p>

    <p>Although social engineering techniques have been used since long ago in other fields (it is worth remembering the famous hoaxes of George Parker – who sold the Eiffel Tower several times – and Carlo Ponzi – with his pyramid scheme – in cyberspace they found a fertile ground and have diversified exponentially. This is due to multiple technological factors, which have generated countless risks that were barely imagined until recently. These are accentuated by big data, cloud computing, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence and machine learning in the web 2.0 and the social networks environment. The risks are varied and include both damage to physical integrity and material damage (for example, the theft of money from an account, the frustration of a contract, etc.) and non-material damage (subsequent moral damage, damage to the reputation, the digital annihilation of the victim, etc.).</p>

    <p>As noted previously, among many examples of the use of false information with the purpose of manipulating the population or certain sectors of it, the alleged impact of information disseminated through social media and its impact on several recent elections is often mentioned. Examples include the tight results of the 2016 UK referendum on whether or not it should continue to be part of the European Union ("Brexit") and the presidential election held in the United States of America that same year, where Donald Trump was also elected by a narrow margin. The most recent case of the 2018 Italian elections is also often mentioned, but there is no consensus that the impact of fake news on this process was significant.</p>

    <p>Cybercriminals’ social engineering attacks are characterized by the use of several techniques, that are used against the victim: reciprocity (something is offered and given, asking then for something in return), authority (the perpetrator presents himself as someone important, for example, a law enforcement officer), urgency (a supposed situation is created to press the victim to do something, such as occurred with the WannaCry cryptoworm in 2017, that affected 230,000 computers in 150 countries), sympathy (projecting confidence and optimism), concession (acknowledging a fault, such as having to deliver a card that should have been replaced some time before, and one is directed to a fake page) and preloading (for example, sending general news about some circumstance and then generating an opportunity about it, getting the victim to click on a link that is sent).</p>

    <p>In international investment, the number of threats to human rights is increasing. Their diversity is directly proportional to the type of activities that could make certain human rights vulnerable. We have seen how the assertion of a human right actually represents a need for protection against threats from individuals, groups or even public authorities. It is important to regulate specific issues through instruments of international law. And in the case of international investments, as in other situations, human rights are put at risk when there is no law enforcement mechanism nor a functioning judicial mechanism to defend them. There is not enough regulation of treatment standards that have a direct impact on human rights. This observation is based on cases where the worst threats to citizens’ human rights come from states. Thus, unequivocal regulation through investment treaties would be very useful.</p>

We live in an era where international investment can be: building and launching satellites, building renewable power plants, building and operating blood plasma fractionation, media services and more. At the same time, the way in which information circulates we know is orchestrated by media or social media service providers, and this is just one example of issues that can have implications for human rights in their diversity.

It reaffirms "the importance of corporate social responsibility, cultural identity and diversity, environmental protection and preservation, gender equality, indigenous rights, labour rights, inclusive trade, sustainable development and traditional knowledge". We are therefore at the intersection of human rights and technological development. In the same vein, problems arise where human rights and freedoms may conflict with the acceptance and use of digitisation. Similarly, cultural or traditional differences may require more attention from digital service providers.  The danger of domination of national digital industries needs to be acknowledged, as issues of national security may overlap here, and the limits of national security and safety are set by domestic regulation and may relate to certain human rights. </p>

Among ethical theories we can observe interesting ideas pointing out internal and external regulation and autonomous and heteronomous motivation for moral actions (e.g., Kant, Kohlberg, virtue ethics). Authors often tend to point out that doing good (morally desirable) things for their own sake, because they are good as such, not just because of, for instance avoiding punishment, is the most desirable. The ideally moral person is often described as such that her/his intentions, motivation and actions are moral and directed towards that which is right or good.</p>

    <p>Technologies that were once believed to help in ensuring human rights can be weaponized by both state and non-state actors. Technology can be used for the surveillance of citizens and the dissemination of disinformation that has the potential to diminish public reliance and trust in scientific data and knowledge. Artificial intelligence is now used daily in a plethora of different ways, including in decision-making in the public and private sectors (e.g. employment, governmental services, in the financial sector and in the justice system), which can pose significant threats to human rights as research has demonstrated that AI may be biased and not able to produce just outcomes in all occasions. AI can also obscure and decrease responsibility for potential human rights violations as it cannot be easily adapted to the traditional mechanisms for holding wrongdoers accountable. </p>

However, along with the introduction of drones into public life, serious privacy issues arise and the ever-increasing usage of drones, due to the scope of increased aerial surveillance possibilities, requires re-estimating the protection of the right to privacy in order to meet the demands of modern society. In this context drones pose a threat: i) first, as a technology, that ‘gives wings’ (and does it at low cost) to other technologies (e.g., cameras, sound recorders, GPS, infrared and other sensors, etc.), thus allowing to use them in a completely new environment, i.e., in the air, obtaining new surveillance possibilities; ii) second, as a platform (base), that integrates various technologies into one whole, including incorporation of AI technology, thus creating qualitatively new surveillance instruments. Therefore, this part of the report also covers threats to privacy connected to drones, in addition to the risks from employing AI.</p>

    <p>AI technologies are expected to bring a wide array of economic and societal benefits to a wide range of sectors, including environment and health, the public sector, finance and justice. However, since AI encompasses directly the lack of human presence, serious concerns arise regarding the protection of privacy and security. Consequently, it will be attempted an exposition of several relevant questions with regard to the aforementioned issues. In its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, the European Commission explicitly highlighted that AI must be used in conjunction with human rights legislation, and especially in deference to the protection of privacy and data rights. As the possibilities for monitoring and analysing people’s daily habits and actions increase, so do the potential implications on human rights.</p>

    <p>Facial recognition is a good example of one area where the competing interests of the benefits of AI and its drawbacks are difficult to judge. facial recognition might have two dimensions: identification and authentication of the person. Identification means that the template of a person’s facial image is compared to many other templates stored in a database to find out if his or her image is stored there. Authentication (or verification)— often referred to as one-to-one matching — enables the comparison of two biometric templates, usually assumed to belong to the same individual. Two biometric templates are compared to determine if the person shown on the two images is the same person. Such a procedure is, for example, used at Automated Border Control gates used for border checks at airports.</p>

As methods of facial recognition are not clear, there are question marks what ‘necessary’ data is to collect. The EDPS has also said that facial recognition is disputable from ethical point of view. The treatment of the human personality as an ‘object’ clearly violates fundamental human rights, weakening the value of the individual.</p>

    <p>Following the adoption of Basic Regulation, the Commission delegated regulation (EU) 2019/945 on unmanned aircraft systems and on third-country operators of unmanned aircraft systems and Commission implementing regulation (EU) 2019/947 on the rules and procedures for the operation of unmanned aircraft were adopted and came into force. Basic Regulation together with the aforementioned two regulations of the European Commission brought in important changes regarding drone operations, especially in relation to the right to privacy and personal data protection. For example, the obligation to register drones and their users and to install direct remote identification systems in unmanned aircrafts was introduced, also courses and exams for remote pilots, which include subjects on right to privacy and data protection, with certificates of the exams valid only for limited period of time (currently for 5 years), which means that remote pilots will have to periodically renew their knowledge on this matter, etc.</p>

    <p>However, at the same time there are many exceptions from such important mechanisms as registration of drones and their users or direct remote identification of unmanned aircrafts, which does not seem to be well founded and make it quite hard to ensure the effectiveness of these measures while protecting the right to privacy and ensuring personal data protection. For example, according to the Implementing regulation (EU) 2019/947 registration of drone operators and obligation to individually mark unmanned aircraft is mandatory only when operating a drone equipped with a sensor able to capture exclusively <em>personal</em> data, which covers only information related to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>, leaving aside the data, which strictly doesn’t fall within the scope of personal data definition, despite the fact, that collection of such data could infringe one’s right to privacy. Moreover, the obligation to register is not applied when using drones, which are considered as toys within the meaning of Directive 2009/48/EC, although the latter also can be fitted with cameras, microphones and various other sensors, available to catch and store both private and personal data. The same goes for direct remote identification system<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>‘Direct remote identification’ means a system that ensures the local broadcast of information about unmanned aircraft (UA) in operation (including the marking of the UA, operator registration number, geographical position of the UA, the route course and ground speed of the UA, geographical position of the remote pilot or, if not available, the take-off point), so that this information can be obtained without physical access to the UA. The similar technical solution was introduced by US Federal aviation administration in December 2020.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>, which is essential for effectively dealing with the issue of drone users’ anonymity and ensuring their traceability, but the requirement to install it doesn’t apply, for example, to drones already made available on the market, despite the fact, that such system can be provided as a separate add-on, which can be retrofitted on drones by their users themselves. Furthermore, the Delegated regulation (EU) 2019/945 sets out the requirements for geo-awareness system, which should alert the remote pilots when a potential breach of airspace limitations is detected so that they can take effective immediate action to prevent that breach in the areas where drone use is restricted, including due to privacy concerns. However, this system is not mandatory, not to talk about geo-fencing system, which is completely left out of EU drone regulations, though it could automatically prevent drones from entering or launching in restricted zones. Drone cyber-security issues are also not covered by these regulations.</p>

Generally, developments in legal drone regulation are usually characterized by a greater centralization, covering wider range of UAV’s, and by taking a risk-based approach, thus with slight variations in the regulations based on type of unmanned aircraft operations being carried out, i.e., different flight purposes (recreational, commercial, etc.), drone size, weight or other specifications (e.g., with or without camera), level of pilot competence, etc. Although there are some differences, these common trends regarding drone regulation worldwide at least when it comes to general rules and principles in relation to drone usage illustrates that there is quite strong consensus on this matter, therefore it is highly plausible that a global (harmonised) framework for drones and their use might be adopted.</p>

    <p>However, the aforementioned developments in drone regulations are not sufficient to the detriment of protection of the right to privacy and personal data. Further joint action at the international level should be taken to develop legal requirements, regarding drone and their user’s registration, geo-awareness and remote identification systems, also to establish common rules <em>inter alia </em>related to drone cyber-security, geo-fencing, etc. Especially when drone manufacturers already apply some of these measures voluntarily (e.g., install geo-fencing systems in their manufactured drones<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>For example, see https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-go-app-now-includes-geo-geofencing-system.</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-go-app-now-includes-geo-geofencing-system' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>).

    <p>On the other hand, it must also be borne in mind, that the use of drones may have the opposite effect and, in some cases, even help to promote human rights, as, for example, is the case in drone journalism (e.g., drones can help journalists to document possible human rights violations in war zones or during demonstrations, etc.). Therefore, more restrictions imposed on drone usage in such cases may lead to weakened protection of other human rights, so the right balance must be struck in this regard.</p>

(1980). The Social Control of Technology.

In other words, when a technology is still at an early stage of development, it is possible to influence the direction of its development, but we do not know yet how it will affect society. However, when the technology has become societally embedded, we do know its implications, but it is very difficult to influence its development. Therefore, by taking a step-by-step legislative approach, based on current state of technological development of drone systems, having in mind the fast pace of technological progress in comparison to evolution of legal regulation, we risk to lag far behind the technology. As drone usage in modern society keeps growing rapidly, it is of great importance to tackle these new challenges related to the right to privacy and personal data protection in a timely manner and ensure that all the conditions are met for the safe and sustainable emergence of innovative drone services, enabling the industry to thrive and at the same time adequately deal with citizens’ concerns.</p>

    <p>Current approaches tend to impose different burdens on state officials and private parties.  Where private parties are concerned, the focus is often protecting freedom of expression, which needs to be maintained particularly during elections.  Government, by contrast, does not have a right to freedom of expression, but a duty first to ensure it does not disseminate false or misleading information itself, second, to respond to and remove disinformation posted by non-state actors when this disinformation can cause a certain level of harm, and, third, to ensure that a single voice does not dominate the marketplace of ideas. </p>

    <p>This approach is supported by the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court, which holds that officials are charged with a more onerous duty to verify the facts, due to their function and the position they occupy in a democratic society.  The Inter-American Court ruled in two resounding cases against Venezuela that the exercise of freedom of expression is not the same when it comes to a merely private subject as opposed to public officials, since in a democratic society it is not only legitimate, rather, it is sometimes the duty of state authorities to rule on matters of public interest.  This duty of special care is particularly accentuated in situations of greater social conflict, disturbances of public order or social or political polarization, precisely because of the set of risks that they may imply for certain people or groups at any given time.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>I/A Court HR.

    <p>Various documents seek to protect the freedom of expression of non-state actors, in particular by discouraging states from using vague or indeterminate criteria when they restrict freedom of expression.  The ‘Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Fake News, Disinformation and Propaganda’ (the Joint Declaration) suggests that states  impose restrictions on the right to freedom of expression only if they be provided for by law, serve one of the legitimate interests recognized under international law, and be necessary and proportionate to protect that interest.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>A position reinforced by The “Joint Declaration on Media Independence and diversity in the digital age”, the “Joint Declaration on Politicians and Public Officials and Freedom of Expression”.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>   The Joint Declaration allows restrictions to prevent advocacy of hatred on protected grounds that constitutes incitement to violence, discrimination or hostility (with reference to Article 20(2), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). It also protects intermediaries distributing third party content and requires an independent oversight mechanism to rule that third party content should be removed before the intermediaries can be held liable for it.  Under the Joint Declaration, state-mandated blocking of entire websites, IP addresses, ports or network protocols are recognised as an extreme measure which can only be justified where provided for by law and where necessary to protect a human right or other legitimate public interest, including in the sense of that it is proportionate, there are no less intrusive alternative measures which would protect the interest and it respects minimum due process guarantees.  Finally, governments may not impose content filtering systems which are not controlled by the end users. The ‘Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Gender Justice’ supports the prohibition of hate speech, applying it specifically to discrimination and sexual and gender-based violence.</p>

    <p>The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) imposes obligations on digital service providers, such as social media or marketplaces, to tackle the spread of illegal content, online disinformation and other societal risks. These requirements are meant to be proportionate to the size and risks that platforms pose to society. Some of these obligations include measures to counter illegal content online and to react quickly, while respecting fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression and data protection. The DSA also compels online platforms to establish a transparency and accountability framework, for example by providing clear information on content moderation or the use of algorithms for recommending content (so-called recommender systems). Further, it bans targeted advertising on online platforms through profiling children or the use of special categories of personal data such as ethnicity, political views or sexual orientation. It also prohibits misleading practices aimed at manipulating users’ choices and gives users with the choice to not receive recommendations based on profiling. The DSA has the potential to significantly improve the mechanisms for removing illegal content and disinformation and effectively protecting users' fundamental rights, but there are many implementation challenges ahead.</p>

Amongst other measures, it encourages states to provide for disciplinary measures to be imposed on public officials who, when acting or perceived to be acting in an official capacity, make, sponsor, encourage or further disseminate statements which they know or should reasonably know to be false and to ensure that public authorities make every effort to disseminate accurate and reliable information, including about their activities and matters of public interest.

It also urges human rights-sensitive solutions to the challenges caused by disinformation, including the growing possibility of ‘deep fakes’, in publicly accountable and targeted ways, using approaches that meet the international law standards of legality, legitimacy of objective, and necessity and proportionality.</p>

Limits on the right to disseminate electoral statements should conform to international standards, including that public figures should be required to tolerate a higher degree of criticism and scrutiny than ordinary citizens.  The media should also be exempted from liability during election periods for disseminating statements made directly by parties or candidates unless the statements have specifically been held to be unlawful by an independent and impartial court or regulatory body, or the statements constitute incitement to violence and the media outlet had a genuine opportunity to prevent their dissemination. </p>

    <p>Any attempt to counter disinformation has to comply with the principles which we have set out in the section regarding the normative system.  These include an ongoing and public discussion on the proportionality analysis by which appropriate levels of intervention in the right to freedom of expression and also the right to privacy are determined.  While it is important to have a normative framework, such a framework requires effective implementation, and we have set out possible mechanisms in the above section regarding practical measures.  We will conclude with five additional observations.</p>

    <p>First, while states are an important cog in the anti-disinformation machinery, they find themselves in an uneven power relationship with transnational online media and, in particular, very large online platforms when it comes to demand and control of information.  States have a duty under human rights law to protect their citizens from the harm caused by disinformation.  But, both due to the power imbalance between themselves and other stakeholders, and because their own credentials are not above suspicion, they cannot act alone. </p>

    <p>Second, further actions need to be taken at global level to limit the huge power large technology companies have over people and democracies. The EU DSA, which introduces new mechanisms for removing illegal content and disinformation while seeking to protect users' fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, could serve as a global benchmark for regulatory approaches to online intermediaries at the global level.</p>

    <p>Third, private content providers need well trained, well supported and well paid content monitors who  scan and delete posts that violate  clearly articulated platform guidelines.  Such platforms should be required by law to ensure the validity of the information shared on them as quickly as possible.  In this regard, we warn against a  lenient approach to the intermediaries through whom information is shared.</p>

<div class="ms-row ms-row-two ms-text" id="partial_230">
  <div class="ms-col-content">
    <p>Fourth, if content providers do not address disinformation, states should work with other stakeholders to identify and counter the disinformation before it can go viral or do significant harm.  We recommend the creation and operation of experienced  and well-resourced units that respond to disinformation as required.  They should identify disinformation and take action to remove and mitigate it. This takes place on the platforms by taking posts down, reporting accounts, requesting bans, as well as sharing and generating accurate information to dispel the disinformation.</p>

    <p>Fifth, any meaningful anti-disinformation programme needs to constrain the state as well as private actors.  This is both because the state may not always have, or deserve, the trust of the general populace, and also because, even in those cases where state bodies may (currently) be trusted to identify and suppress disinformation in good faith, unaccountable and concentrated power can lead to abuse.  The institutional design of the anti-disinfomation therefore needs to include checks and balances to counter the power of both the state and big tech.  We suggest that expert units be staffed by people who are not connected to any social media distributers; that is, people with training in the area of disinformation but no financial or political incentive either to suppress or promote particular narratives.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>The South African NGOs ‘Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change’ and ‘Real411’ are good examples of such independent fact-checkers.  See https://cabc.org.za/ and https://www.real411.org/.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a>  These independent units need to monitor and analyse the distribution of information on social media.  Such teams should be allocated to specific areas of interest and specialization, including disinformation, incitement to violence, hate speech and xenophobia (broad types of information). </p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="ms-row ms-row-two ms-text" id="partial_233">
  <div class="ms-col-content">
    <p>These teams should be located outside of the state, but will need to work in conjunction with organs of state to handle crises and identify emerging threats. Co-operation is necessary because the civil units may not have the capacity to remedy disinformation (which generally requires a real-time response) or to address forms of disinformation which threaten to develop into a crisis such as an insurrection. Government may be needed to provide the person-power and forms of state-sanctioned coercion when strictly necessary.  It should should thus have access to the knowledge produced by such bodies, and should have dedicated units gaining it and analysing it to be able to respond in a multisectoral manner (there is, for example, a different set of skills required to combat vaccine hesitancy than there is to prevent posts which are organizing an insurrection).</p>

    <p>Co-operation between state and non-state actors should not, in itself, promote abuse of power by the state provided the institutional structure keeps the state in dialogue with other actors and accounting to civil society. A healthy institutional structure will facilitate the interaction of NGOs, the private sector, international organisations, such as the United Nations, and governments.  Disinformation is a global phenomenon, and these forms of co-operation allow for a global response.</p>

    <p>Two human rights that are particularly vulnerable in the digital context are the right to privacy and the freedom of expression. Firstly, privacy has been eroded in the digital context, often with the assistance of the people themselves. The majority of the people are unaware of the extent to which our privacy is impacted by digital means. Peoples’ habits are being tracked; data collected at every click of the mouse. Since most human activities leave behind some kind of digital data trail, it has become increasingly easy to track the behaviour of private individuals.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>OECD, “The OECD Privacy Framework” (2013), Chapter 2, Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum to the Revised Recommendation of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (2013), p 20.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> Personal data can reveal very intimate details about a person’s character, lifestyle and choices. It is often not realized that personal data can be easily misused or used for commercial purposes. This includes using personal data in ways that were not intended at the time of collection. The economic value of personal data is constantly increasing; thus, personal data has become the cornerstone of various business models both online and offline.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Macenaite, M., “The ‘Riskification’ of European Data Protection Law through a Two-fold Shift”, 8(1) <em>European Journal of Risk Regulation</em> 506 (2017), p 506.

    <p>Secondly, the freedom of expression can be both abused and limited in the online context. Anonymity and the impersonality of the social media and the Internet has resulted in the proliferation of hate speech online. The opportunity to broadcast your point of view to the world in seconds is a mixed blessing. Freedom of expression moving online has also given both governments and (social) media platforms new opportunities to exercise censorship.  This part of the report will highlight some of the plethora of risks that arise in relation to the right to privacy and the freedom of expression online.</p>

    <p>The right to travel or otherwise the freedom of movement is part of Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Privacy is a protected human right linked with private life worldwide and is contained in Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. However, it varies from a fundamental right (e.g. in India) or constitutional right (e.g. in Israel) to a qualified right in other countries where absolute rights such as national security interfere (e.g. in the United States).

The right to privacy has been derived from a broader conceptualisation of data protection legislation. More than 100 countries have introduced the right to protect personal data, which consequently became intertwined with digital human rights. The latter is pertinent in an era of rapid technological advancements in particular within the mobility and transport sector, where digital mobility and transport automation are prevailing.</p>

    <p>A range of direct and indirect threats to the data protection and privacy rights have become apparent in what evolves as a global mobility market. The modern way of living further promotes mobility for work, leisure and to nurture social relationships. Mobility seems an ever increasing trend as shown in the COVID-19 aftermath, increasing at the same time potential threats to digital rights. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel was severely restricted, relevant threats emerged regarding privacy and data protection by the use of digital mobility apps such as the Strava app imposed by the Alesund local authority in Norway.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/alesund-municipality-fined-for-use-of-strava/</p><a class='mdi mdi-earth' href='https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/alesund-municipality-fined-for-use-of-strava' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'></a>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> The app was used to monitor physical exercise at local schools and was tracking movement, whilst also collecting personal data without explicit consent by the app users. Other cases of concern include monitoring of employees via CCTV or other tracking technologies such as sensors, which are widely used in the transport and logistics industry. The increase of home deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic, further increased the need to address relevant threats regarding the rights of privacy and data protection of both workers and customers. An additional concern is the non-explicit disclosure of mobility or mental disabilities to third parties.</p>

For example, digital mobility platforms promoting Mobility-as-a-Service include by default a wide range of transport providers, often based in different countries or even continents, offering taxi, bus, train, bicycle, e-scooter travel options.

For example, the major social media firms have removed hundreds of ISIS accounts since 2015, seeking to reduce the UN‑designated terrorist group’s reach online, which forced them onto less public and more closed platforms, reducing their visibility and public outreach, but also making it more difficult to monitor their activities. In 2018, Facebook and Instagram deplatformed (Facebook, 2018) the Myanmar (Facebook, 2018) military after it was involved in the genocide of Rohingya, closing hundreds of pages and accounts related to the military and banning several affiliated users and organizations from its services.</p>

    <p>In recent years, scholars and mainstream news outlets have frequently criticized social media platforms for not doing enough to efficiently moderate their content. In response, platforms have stepped up their content moderation efforts to curb the online spread of hate speech, misinformation and conspiracy theories. For example, Twitter has labelled tweets that violate its guidelines, including those posted by former US President Trump, as offensive. Pinterest has blocked search results for anti-vaccination queries in an effort to fight the spread of vaccine misinformation. Reddit has banned certain toxic communities and quarantined others. Facebook has identified Nazi and white nationalist groups on its platform and shared them with non-profits who help people leave such hate groups.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>S.

    <p>At the same time deplatforming has been criticised as raising unprecedented threats to democracy and freedom of expression of citizen. James Titcomb: At one level, a private company is perfectly within its rights to terminate a legal contract for services that a user has entered into voluntarily, on terms and conditions specified by the company. The problem is that a handful of big tech companies have amassed oligopolistic control of social media platforms with global reach and impact. For all the awfulness of Trump’s communications, it was extraordinary and unprecedented for an incumbent, democratically elected head of state to be blocked from communicating with tens of millions of followers through the world's most popular online services. As Fraser Myers (2021) commented: "If the tech monopolies can deny a platform to the leader of the free world, then they can deny a voice to anyone".<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>D.

    <p>For example, a Dutch court recently allowed a citizen-journalism initiative to sue YouTube for removing some of its videos which had been taken down for violating YouTube’s rules on Covid-19 disinformation. While the Court did not order the reinstatement of the videos, it did find that aspects of YouTube’s disinformation policy went too far, and were "not permitted" under the right to freedom of expression. Importantly, the Dutch Court recognised that YouTube had a “great responsibility” because it is one of the largest online platforms with a worldwide reach and plays a “dominant role” in public debate online.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Court of Amsterdam 09.09.2020. judgment in caseC/13/687385 / KG ZA 20-650 CdK/BB; R Fahy, J.

A representative example appeared in 2017, in a <em>Fordham Law Review</em> article by Danielle Citron and Benjamin Wittes, who argued that Section 230 should be revised with the following (highlighted) changes: "No provider or user of an interactive computer service <em>that takes reasonable steps to address known unlawful uses of its services that create serious harm to others</em> shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider <em>in any action arising out of the publication of content provided by that information content provider</em>."<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>D.

    <p>The platforms are the gatekeepers of information and have numerous effective tools in their arsenal to restrict or disseminate certain information. Therefore, it is reasonable that states have imposed primary duties on platforms to eliminate such harmful content as for instance incitement to violence and hatred.

On one side of the Atlantic, the right to be forgotten (hereinafter: RtbF) was acknowledged by the court and on the other, the court held that true information could not be deleted. However, they shared the idea that the concept of the RtbF raises serious concerns with respect to free expression.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Jones, M.

    <p>The whole concept refers to information that is in the public domain. Therefore, the right of the public to be adequately informed, in particular on matters of public interest, should be considered as an important parameter. For example, "irrelevant" information should not necessarily mean that personal interests prevail over public interest due to the fact that trivial information for one person is of great importance for another one. Who should judge public interest in this case? Moreover, the RtbF allows individuals to request removal of information that is not false or defamatory, but true and originally published in a fully legal manner, because such data are at the moment not flattering to the concerned individual. Does it mean that we should ignore the right of the public to be adequately informed and move legal and completely true information in order to repackage someone’s existence online?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, RtbF could be used as an instrument of censorship by making it difficult or impossible to search for relevant articles associated with an individual. Since the aforementioned ruling, a number of controversial links to pages have been removed from Google’s search results, though these links are not controversial to everyone. Google removed links connecting British individuals to their criminal convictions but not those of Swiss individuals, and a district court in Amsterdam decided that Google did not need to delete the data because "negative publicity as a result of a serious crime in general is accurate permanent relevant information about a person".</p>

    <p>In light of the fact that the GDPR sketches only faint boundaries for the RtbF, search engine operators determine which data deletion requests should be granted and which should be denied without any appropriate guidance. Google issued guidelines for implementing the ruling, which instructs interpretations to be made within existing national law. The guidelines provide substantive direction in the form of criteria for the data-protection authorities’ handling of the right to be forgotten complaints. In this regard, allowing private businesses to act as both adjudicators and administrators in matters of freedom of expression is a risky combination that may limit freedom of speech since search engine operators are not well equipped to act as both. Why do we expect search engine operators to be able to strike a balance between RtbF and freedom of expression without any specified standards related to it and under the pressure that the refusal of the request could lead to enormous fines?</p>

    <p>The GDPR, leaning on a technology-agnostic approach and making room for future innovations, did not bind, in article 17, provisions to current trends and state-of-the-art technologies, intentionally leaving it up to provides to enact standards that will help them determine what information should be removed. The lack of guidelines on how such a complex legal mechanism should be implemented within an already sophisticated and interdependent environment has sparked questions about legitimacy, while commercial reputation-enhancing use of the right has attributed to it the title of a concealed form of censorship from critics.</p>

    <p>While criticism of "forgetting" has justification, the mechanism itself is not a novel one, i.e. it has been used previously in criminal law. Furthermore, the lack of consensus on the implementation of the right to be forgotten, opens the door for a diverse set of responses countries can adopt in trying to reconcile the conflict between the right to be forgotten and freedom of speech. In this regard, proportionality can be utilised and factor-based balancing favoured; countries can legally enact and take advantage of various models and legal reasoning available within the international human rights protection system.</p>

    <p>No jurisdiction can escape from the difficulty of clarifying criteria in order to strike a fair balance among equally important competing values of privacy and the freedom of expression. While the Court of Justice of the European Union is known for its hard stance regarding the right to data protection, its decisions in <em>Google v CNIL</em> and <em>GC and Others</em> could be seen as lowering that protection. Namely, the Court did not opt for global de-referencing – the only mechanism capable of guaranteeing complete protection of the right to data protection – and considered the processing of sensitive data by a search engine operator lawful until obtaining a request for de-referencing, even without one of the exceptions enshrined in Art. 9(2) GDPR being fulfilled. </p>

    <p>The right to be forgotten can no longer be seen merely as a right to delete information or to preclude its diffusion, as it was originally the case.  In a rapidly advancing technological world, one must understand the right in a more multifaceted way.

Just as for the original pre-Internet right to be forgotten, this entitlement finds its justification in the recognition of the right to personal freedom, dignity, and self-realization.</p>

<li>Economic reasons – in addition to the problems of the country / region, people's own economic opportunities are a separate problem.</li>
<li>Lack of skills – the internet may be available, but often there are no skills to navigate it successfully. The development of digital skills is still in its infancy in the world, but the user base is growing.</li>
<li>Linguistic accessibility problems – the Internet is mainly in English. Most social media sites operate in either English or the local main language (Russian, Mandarin), which continues to ignore those who do not speak it.</li>
<li>Special needs – the Internet is an audiovisual medium that requires user activity. More and more attention is being paid to the fact that the deaf, blind and other people with special needs have been left out of the development of the Internet.</li>
<li>Restricting access as a goal – because the internet is so important in today's world, network restrictions are common as a punitive or governmental repressive measure. It is possible to shut down the internet altogether or block access to certain topics.</li>

Freedom of expression and assembly are increasingly being used online, so if you do not have that opportunity, your rights will be restricted. Secondly, the digital divide is having a negative impact on education. The Internet is a rich body of information, the loss of which is a major obstacle to learning. School tasks increasingly involve the use of computers and the Internet, so the lack of access to these resources can seriously affect children's right to education. Third, the number of jobs requiring digital skills is growing rapidly. The digital divide limits access to these jobs and the associated income. Lack of digital skills can ultimately lead to a complete lack of job opportunities, which can infringe on a person's right to work. The digital divide also exacerbates socioeconomic and other vulnerabilities by barring many people from the information necessary to break out of their current living situation.</p>

This magnifies inequalities and leads to an unjust world, which has been recognised internationally on the highest level.

The gender gap in global Internet use is a stark example – in two out of every three countries, more men use the Internet than women. ...

    <p>Although the issue of protecting children on the internet popped up on the radar of policymakers around mid-1990s, a more holistic approach that focusses on the full range of children’s rights that are impacted in the digital environment has only gained traction in recent years.

The recommendation states that the digital environment<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>This notion is understood as ‘encompassing information and communication technologies (ICTs), including the internet, mobile and associated technologies and devices, as well as digital networks, databases, content and services’.</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> reshapes ‘children’s lives in many ways, resulting in opportunities for and risks to their well-being and enjoyment of human rights’,<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Council of Europe (2018).

    <p>A number of instruments that have been adopted as well as a consistent case law of the European Court of Human Rights witness to this stance and the efforts undertaken by this organization to prevent and possibly punish hate speech.  The situation was, however, exacerbated by the unprecedented spread of the use of social media and online hate speech. The Internet, once perceived as the bastion of free speech and enabler of other rights and freedoms, has provided a platform for discrimination, intolerance, bigotry and hatred towards the most vulnerable minority groups – ethnic, sexual, gender, religious, etc. The advantages of online interaction, including anonymity, accessibility, and affordability have also played in favour of those aiming at spreading hatred.</p>

Member states are called to address the rise in hate speech, especially in the online sphere, through adoption of a comprehensive legal and policy framework. The Council maintained the existing notion that the most serious forms of hate speech should be addressed through criminal legislation, while other less severe expressions are to be tackled through other means, including civil and administrative law. Forms of speech which are not serious enough to be considered in violation of the Convention should nevertheless be addressed through alternative responses.</p>

    <p>Concerning online hate speech, specific guidelines are given to states to ensure clear and foreseeable provisions for the effective removal of speech that is prohibited under criminal, civil and administrative law. In following the guidelines, member states should ensure that freedom of expression is protected as guaranteed under Article 10 and in accordance with the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights. As regards the recent case law of the Court and concerning justified restrictions of online speech, in the recent case of <em>Lilliendahl v. Iceland</em> (29297/18), the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for the first time posed a direct question of whether applicant’s comments (about LGBT population) amounted to hate speech. The Court provided a lengthy explanation of the question in the light of the existing Court’s case law. Finding that the speech amounted to less grave forms of hate speech, and therefore considered under Article 10, the Court nevertheless sided with the national court, which noted that the applicant’s comments were "serious, severely hurtful and prejudicial", and even though there was no direct call or incitement to violence, it fell outside the protections of the ECHR. Concerning criminal liability of online users for comments posted on social media, in the recent case of <em>Sanchez v France </em>, the Fifth Section of the Court of Human Rights held that the conviction of a politician for failing to promptly delete unlawful comments (hateful and racist comments directed at Muslims in France) published by third parties on the public wall of his Facebook account did not breach his rights under Article 10 despite his apparent lack of knowledge of the comments.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Quoted source" data-content="<p>Case Law, Strasbourg: Sanchez v France, Politician fined for failing to delete Facebook hate speech, no violation of Article 10 – Inforrm's Blog</p>" data-html="true"><i></i></a> The decision is based on the principles established in <em>Delfi v.

    <p>The consistent policy with respect to examples of hate crime online is also a prerequisite regardless of its author. Technical difficulties in identifying the author are not easy to overcome so attempts to at least minimize the presence of hate crime in some of the controlled media should be maximized, such as comments on articles in media.</p>

    <p>The stances of the European Court of Human Rights in the recent decisions concerning online hate speech also show a trend of narrowing of scope of protected speech under Article 10. This development seems to be a reflection of the global social and political context of migrations and the Covid-19 pandemic. More countries introduce more stringent rules on online speech, in efforts to address numerous concerns, relating not only to hate speech, but also complex misinformation narratives and conspiracy theories’ effects on public order and safety. These needs may also be reflected in the future decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

    <p>Despite the plethora of different threats to human rights protection from the digital environment, the trend of digitalisation will continue and impact us even more profoundly in the years to come. Therefore, it is imperative to keep in mind the risks (both highlighted in this report and others) and take action to minimize them to ensure the benefits of digital technology outweigh the negatives. All actors connected to the digital world need to acknowledge the human rights impact of their actions and weigh the potentially conflicting human rights and other considerations in their decision-making process. If the risks are given due consideration, then digital means can be utilised to ensure human rights protection both online and offline.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19143/">GDHRNet COST Action</a> will systematically explore the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of human rights. The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility. </p>

    <p>The Action will propose a comprehensive system of human rights protection online, in the form of recommendations of the content assessment obligation by online companies, directed to the companies themselves, European and international policy organs, governments and the general public. The Action will also develop a model which minimizes the risk of arbitrary assessment of online content and instead solidifies standards which are used during content assessment; and maximizes the transparency of the outcome. </p>

    <p>The Action will achieve scientific breakthroughs (a) by means of a quantitative and qualitative assessment of whether private Internet companies provide sufficient protection of human rights online in comparison with judicial institutions, (b) in the form of a novel holistic theoretical approach to the potential role of artificial intelligence in protecting human rights online, and (c) by providing policy suggestions for private balancing of fundamental rights online. </p>

    <p>Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and collaborate. All the information can be found in the booklet “COST Actions against COVID-19 – An interdisciplinary network”.</p>

    <p>As the full consequences of the current pandemic are yet unknown and the threat of a future pandemic is always present, the Network of Actions offers considerable potential in mobilising experts and tackling challenges as they arise. The Network is open to other participants and completely bottom-up. Any Actions wishing to join it can do so by contacting the COST Science Officer coordinating this initiative. </p>
