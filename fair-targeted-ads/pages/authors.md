description: I’m a DPhil (PhD) candidate at the University of Oxford’s Internet Institute, and a Research Associate at the Alan Turing Institute. For me, content moderation is the thin end of the wedge when it comes to big tech’s use of AI. I see my part of my mission as demystifying and demythologising new technology like AI, the rhetoric around which can often lead us to focus on theoretical problems arising 50 years from now, when in reality we should be thinking about the next 5 years — as dangers like automated facial recognition and the algorithmically powered spread of harmful content online pose increasing risks to human rights and democratic discourse.

description: I am a PhD candidate at the Hertie School where I am affiliated to the Centre for Digital Governance. In my dissertation project I am applying methods from the interdisciplinary fields of computational social science and social data science to better understand the impact of social platforms on democracy, and in particular on political campaigning and democratic elections. The current implementation of content moderation and systems for algorithmic filtering is a pivotal puzzle piece to better understand how policy makers can effectively regulate harmful and illegal behaviors on social platforms and at the same time limit possible negative effects on democratic values such as liberty, equality and diversity.

description: I am a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Law of Maastricht University. My mission as a researcher is to promote digital civil rights. In my PhD project, I examine the dynamics of EU intermediary liability framework and its impact on freedom of expression and information online. Having started my academic journey only recently, I appreciate every opportunity to get to know researchers with similar interests; that is why I jumped at the chance to become a fellow of the research sprint. If we can rely on flexible, but commonly acknowledged ethical principles, we will be able to ensure productive collaboration between different actors in the online realm.

description: I am an Assistant Professor in Intellectual Property Law at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society (TILT) of Tilburg University, The Netherlands. The topic of platform governance and online service provider liability for user-generated content forms a core component of my ongoing research. I am particularly interested in exploring how the deployment of algorithmic content moderation systems could impact on creativity and the promotion of dialogic interaction within the digital environment. Furthermore, I am curious to examine whether existing legislative, regulatory and policy frameworks on algorithmic content moderation could be calibrated in a manner that enables online platforms to flourish as open public spaces for robust and ethical social discourse.

description: "Digital humanism might sound like an oxymoron, but I consider myself a ‘technological/digital humanist’: A computer scientist working in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, ICT and international research policy, and a philosopher tackling complex questions arising from digital disruption within our society. I am an international technology consultant specializing in ICT, innovation and digitization topics and the founder of eutema, a Vienna-based technology and RTD strategy consultancy which works with clients such as the European Commission, Austrian ministries and agencies, universities and industry. I am a frequent evaluator for European RTD projects and policy measures. You can see the list of Institutions with which I have worked here. I am also an academic with teaching experience in courses on innovation, cognitive science, robotics and linguistics at both the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology. "

description: My name is Dominiquo Santistevan. I’m currently pursuing my PhD in Sociology at the University of Chicago after having studied computer science and worked in the ‘AI for social good’ space for a couple years. For me, artificial intelligence is a manifestation of what has appeared as the natural trend towards an informational world, and it is through these functions of compression that we increasingly engage with our world. Therefore, as researchers, it’s important for us to critique, understand, and produce research that examines these systems of information, which will allow us to reimagine that which may appear as natural. I’m glad to take part in this research sprint with the HIIG because, through its interdisciplinary focus, I am able to engage with literature and conversation beyond my standard domain of comfort. Through this collision of disciplines, hopefully we can create some novelty and clarity to enrich the conversation on the future of AI and society.

description: I am now a PhD Candidate at the University of Hong Kong. I also engage as an Administrative Officer at Creative Commons Hong Kong. Trained in Engineering and Law, I focus my research interests on IP & IT Law, Innovation Policy, particularly employing Computational Legal Studies and Data Science. I was exploring the Chinese digital policies by contributing to the CyberBRICS Project hosted by the institutions across Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as the Global Data Justice Project funded by the European Research Council (ERC). My research experience drove me to apply for this project, and HIIG has been providing me with a global and interdisciplinary platform for intellectual exchange on AI and platform governance. This research will also be an opportunity for me to comb through what I have done in terms of AI ethics and algorithmic society and receive a broad viewpoint in a team consisting of those friends from IT, law, sociological and political sciences. I hypothesise that the current multilateral splinternet is rooted in a long-lasting gap of cultural identification. The ongoing content mediation systems have shown more far-reaching implications of behavioural transformation, and once bureaucratically observed, Internet regulations across jurisdictions are shaping the algorithm-based automatic mechanisms created by platforms. As scholars, we will be creating knowledge and linking our objective research to the diverse stakeholders in both Global North and South, including researchers, enterprises, civic societies and political groups to open the floor for further dialogue and clarification of law and policy debates.
