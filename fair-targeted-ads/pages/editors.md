# The Ethics of Digitalisation

**This policy brief forms the output of the spring 2021 Clinic *Increasing Fairness in Targeted Advertising: The Risk of Gender Stereotyping by Job Ad Algorithms*, which was hosted virtually by the HIIG from February to March 2021.**<br>
The Global Network of Internet and Society Research Centers (NoC) research project _The Ethics of Digitalisation - From Principles to Practices_ promotes an active exchange and aims to foster a global dialogue on the ethics of digitalisation by involving stakeholders from academia, civil society, policy, and the industry. Research sprints and clinics form the core of the project; they enable interdisciplinary scientific work on application-, and practice-oriented questions and challenges and achieve outputs of high social relevance and impact. The virtual Clinic brought together twelve fellows from six continents and eight disciplines. During two intense weeks in February 2021, they participated in an interdisciplinary solution-oriented process facilitated by a project team at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society. The fellows also had the chance to learn from and engage with a number of leading experts on targeted advertising, who joined the Clinic for thought-provoking spark sessions.
