    <p>In life, there is no digital switch. Digital change, like other transformative processes, takes universities on adventurous and challenging journeys. Educational technology, a pedagogical approach that infuses technology into the classroom, brings change to the heart of the university. Digitizing the learning experience can include incorporating an array of different software and hardware: learning management platforms, communication tools, and technical equipment. However, implementing these changes involves coordinating various organizational processes related to leadership, strategy, infrastructure, and most importantly, creating an organizational culture which inspires motivation and engagement among university teachers. </p>

    <p>As a companion on this journey, the Practitioners' Field Guide for Implementing Educational Technology offers directions for those navigating the sometimes turbulent, but rich road of implementing educational technology. In this guide, we offer research-based recommendations and data-derived best practices which draw on the findings of the <a href="#heading-95">OrA Project</a> a cooperation between the <a href="https://www.hiig.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society</a> and the FernUniversität in Hagen, <a href="https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/research/clusters/catalpa/">CATALPA</a> - Center of Advanced Technology for Assisted Learning and Predictive Analytics. Readers will gain insight on six key themes related to organizing educational technology across a higher education institution: <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>infrastructure</strong>, <strong>networks</strong>, <strong>engagement</strong> and <strong>motivation</strong>. </p>

    <p>The guide covers these themes in six sections: Leading with educational technology, Creating a common vision, Building a strong foundation, Maintaining connections, Unpacking resistance, and Fostering motivation. In the sections, we provide university managers and administrators, teachers as well as technical staff insight into overcoming central implementation challenges. Each section includes an overview text with the main research takeaways as well as an exercise – discussion guide, steps, or case study example – to equip readers with food for thought.  The sections are designed to operate as standalone references as well as collectively address interconnected organizational processes at work. <br />
Readers are encouraged to select sections and combinations that fit the needs of their institutions. </p>

    <p>The <strong>second step</strong> is to involve both informal and institutional leaders in administrative discussions about educational technology. Most importantly, informal leaders should be granted decision-making capacities regarding the application and selection of educational technology in their respective disciplines. In addition, they should be given a voice in related issues such as strategy building, funding, teacher training, incentive schemes and other organizational matters. We found in our case studies that giving informal leaders the power to make changes about educational technology policy kept motivation high in such partnerships.</p>

    <p>Forming a central strategy is often a first step for institutions seeking to incorporate educational technology. Such strategies can provide a platform to share institutional visions and values as well as offer guidance for decision-makers and practitioners alike. For example, strategies on educational technology can outline different technology options, clarify the responsibilities of different actors, highlight common goals as well as communicate the institution’s approach to outsiders.</p>

<p>Drawing on our research, we recommend starting with the basics by creating a common vision for educational technology.

        <h2>Steps for creating a common vision</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1: Getting started</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who should become involved in administrative discussions about educational technology? Where are these individuals located? How can their expertise and time commitment be recognized?</li>
<li>What are our motivations for implementing educational technology at our institution / faculty / department?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Communicating  expectations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Should a strategy on educational technology guide daily practices or be more in the background?</li>
<li>Should a strategy include subgoals for different units (e.g. study programs / departments / faculties)?</li>
<li>Should a strategy solve specific problems related to the implementation of educational technology?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Forming a common vision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the common vision of our institution combining the ideas and topics collected in step 2?  </li>
<li>Break down the common vision into actionable steps: How can our vision be put into practice? What are concrete ways the vision can be reached?</li>
<li>How can the vision be communicated to the larger institutional community for feedback and reworking?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Ongoing evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit the vision at intervals: Does our vision still fit the needs of the community? Have our motivations, communities or practices changed?</li>

        <p><strong>Learning Technologist working at the Faculty Level</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does a learning technologist do?</strong><br />
“...our approach is rather customized. There's no one model that is universal, because obviously courses have different outcomes, learning objectives, target groups and assignments, etc. … we ask [teachers] for the scenarios, once they send us the scenarios we respond with individual emails. So, for example, if a person says: “I want to do pre-recorded lectures with webinars.” Then we will follow up with customized questions and advice … Do you need a teaching assistant? How would you record them? What would be the workload and things like that?”</p>
<p><strong>How does a learning technologist influence teaching?</strong><br />
“In our case, I think we [teachers] are absolutely free. What is controlled is the compliance of correspondence of our syllabi, our Moodle pages with technical requirements. For example, there should be a clear list of topics, short description, and then the literature, home reading and then all assignments will be very clearly indicated, including grading policy. … For example, if your grading policy is not clear, you will definitely receive a message from someone who's in charge of that, just a friendly reminder that you need to revise them because it's not clear what is A, what is B, what is C? …. When it comes to the content, it's up to the individual teachers and instructors. The university helps us with teaching assistants and with training sessions.”</p>

        <h3>Unpacking Resistance with Professor X</h3>
<p>The story of Professor X draws on aggregated data from our empirical studies. Professor X embodies common themes related to resistant behaviors and rationales identified in the data.</p>
<p>Professor X is a well-respected researcher in their field and also widely considered a great lecturer by students and peers alike. When their institution canceled in-person teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Prof. X along with their colleagues had to move their lectures online. While their colleagues struggled and put in extra hours to redesign their lectures, Prof. X avoided making changes to their lectures. Instead, they decided to just move their regular lectures to video calls, not changing the didactic approach or format. After a while, students and colleagues noticed a steep drop in the quality of Prof. X’s lectures – student engagement and attendance were poor and student performance was lower than usual. When asked about this, Prof. X stated that they were just waiting until the situation returned to normal and hoped to get back quickly to the lecture hall. However, as time passed, educational technology continued to be used and efforts were being invested in maintaining its presence in the curriculum. Yet, Prof. X still refused to change their ways of online teaching and lecturing. </p>
<h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What do you think are the reasons behind Prof. X’s behavior? </li>
<li>Is Prof. X’s behavior justifiable? If so, why?</li>
<li>What do Prof. X’s actions mean for his colleagues and their work with them? </li>
<li>Should Prof. X be convinced to act differently? What can be said or done?</li>
<li>Who should be the one(s) doing the convincing?</li>
<li>Have you managed to convince a Prof. X at your institution to behave differently?</li>
<li>What reasons were given by Prof. X at your institution for their behavior?</li>
<li>What institutional practices can help Prof. X?</li>

    <p>A productive and imaginative use of educational technology depends largely on the people who use it and their motivation.

        <p><em>Examples from a research university</em></p>
<p><strong>Personal praise from students</strong></p>
<p>“I get more or less direct feedback from the students for [online] interactions that we have. A "thank you very much" or another question. And in fact, some of the students are also very, very grateful. They get back to me and say, "Now everything has worked out.”</p>
<p><strong>Confident use of tools</strong></p>
<p>“I have to say, once you master a few tools, that [didactic difficulties are] no longer an issue. These are tools that just really work as well as pencil and paper by now. … It's getting better and better, and of course with more complicated programs, you learn it bit by bit. So I can now say that I can make quite decent videos. Of course, it wasn't like that at the beginning. But it's a learning process.”</p>
<p><em>Examples from a university of applied science</em></p>
<p><strong>Exchange and cooperation</strong></p>
<p>“We can exchange ideas relatively quickly. …  Sometimes the scientific team comes and says: "Hey, I have an idea, could we somehow make a tutorial out of it or could we somehow produce some cool video or something on this topic." And that's often how these ideas develop and I think that's actually very cool because we just kind of help each other out.”</p>
<p><strong>Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>“We are not so stuck in our ways, but have the freedom to think about what really makes sense here, or what could be exciting. …  When someone says: ‘Hey, let's test this program, maybe it will be useful for us,’ then we actually don't have anyone who says: ‘No, we will not do that,’ but we simply try it out. And we try an exercise with it, and if it just isn't anything, then it isn't, but then we know.”</p>
<p><strong>Training opportunities</strong></p>
<p>“[We] just check ourselves, what would be useful, what we would perhaps still be able to do in terms of technical know-how. And then we can actually choose relatively independently what kind of training really helps us.”</p>

<p>In the real world, there is no digital switch. Practical steps need to be taken to transfer the physical to the digital realm. Implementing educational technology means taking into account different organizational layers, the ways in which these layers intersect and the multiple groups of individuals working in these spaces. The Practitioners’ Field Guide for Implementing Educational Technology highlights six topics – leadership, strategy, infrastructure, networks, engagement, and motivation – which contribute to how educational technology is perceived, experienced, and structured in higher education institutions. </p>

    <p>Analogue teaching cannot be instantly transferred online. Rather the process of implementing educational technology (Edtech) involves organizational change. In our research  project, <a href="https://www.hiig.de/project/organisationale-adaptivitaet-im-deutschen-hochschulkontext-ora/">Organizational Adaptivity in the German Higher Education Context (OrA)</a>, we investigated the organizational change that occurs during the adoption and implementation of Edtech in higher education institutions.  The OrA project was a three-year (2020-2023) cooperation between the <a href="https://www.hiig.de/en/research/learning-knowledge-innovation/">Research Programme: Knowledge &amp; Society</a> at the <a href="https://www.hiig.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society</a> and <a href="https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/research/clusters/catalpa/">CATALPA</a> - Center of Advanced Technology for Assisted Learning and Predictive Analytics at the <a href="https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/index.shtml">FernUniversität in Hagen</a>.</p>

    <p>Through three empirical studies, the OrA project provided new insight into the organizational layer involved in implementing Edtech at universities. Specifically, we sought to identify the organizational factors and processes – leadership structures, institutional policy, staff motivation, infrastructure and resources, that shape institutional Edtech approaches and staff experiences with these technologies.</p>

    <p>Our research also furthered our understanding of organizational processes involved in Edtech success, such as the importance of finding <a href="https://www.medienpaed.com/article/view/1216">the right balance</a> between organizational support and academic freedom when it comes to implementing Edtech. This translated into university management providing teaching staff with resources, training, and guidelines and at the same time safeguarding their freedom to experiment with digital technologies. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hiig.de/publication/the-power-of-informal-networks-how-middle-management-central-leadership-and-trust-can-impact-innovation-at-the-university/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1679059709287748&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ADr0XWklcc-rZ2Tt6fdmv">Collegial networks</a>, we found, also play a key role in motivating teaching staff to engage with Edtech as well as serve as hubs for innovation, knowledge sharing and moral support.

This framework, based on a systematic review of studies published in top Edtech journals over the last decade, consists of three organizational pillars: Leadership &amp; Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Resources and Recognition &amp; Motivation.</p>

    <p>The Practitioners’ Field Guide for Implementing Educational Technology draws on these research findings with the purpose of sharing insights with practitioners working with Edtech. In the spirit of the OrA project, the field guide is a product of collaboration with higher education practitioners. The design of the OrA project followed an <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JMTM-09-2018-0304/full/html">interactive research model</a>. In this model, research participants – university leaders, administrators, technical staff, and teaching staff – were involved in various stages of the research process. This included partaking in interviews and surveys, in addition to participating in case study selection, workshops and creating this field guide. This collaborative approach was essential to the success of the project and the richness of the data collected. We wholeheartedly thank all our participants for their time and effort!</p>
