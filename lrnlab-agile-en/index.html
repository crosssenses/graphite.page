    <div class="ms-col-content">
      <p>This is one of the most common terms you will hear today in 
many organisations. Organisations want to be agile, teams are supposed 
to work in an agile way and everything, suddenly, needs to happen so 
much faster. Is this movement just a farce, or are we really faced with a
 serious phenomenon? The fact is that successful organisations in the 
digital age are noticeably quick to adapt to changes in their 
environment. Globalisation increases the intensity of flows of good, 
information, and migration, by destabilising the political and economic 
order. The political scientist Ian Bremmer refers to this as Zero 
Gravity World. What he means here is the growing political instability 
in view of shifts in economic power. But the term can also be understood
 as a status description of a world in which economic conditions are 
volatile, technological advances exponential and cultural evolution of 
human beings challenges old values and organisational modes.</p>

    <p>The dynamism of actual markets has striking similarities with 
that of the manufacturing age. Up to the year 1900, high transport costs
 meant that most markets had just a short range, and were local and 
narrow. Competitors could avoid each other. This direct contact forced 
creativity and generated dynamism.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Oestereich, B., &amp; Schröder, C. (2017). Das kollegial geführte Unternehmen: Ideen und Praktiken für die agile Organisation von morgen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 After 1900, falling transport costs were responsible for the emergence 
of new mass markets, which were wider in range and comparatively 
sluggish. Companies could expand their businesses without any problem, 
and at the same time optimise their internal processes. Taylorism and 
Fordism were characterised by scientific management, which introduced 
and enforced strict division of labour and work planning – with 
resounding success, as industrial production grew to a hundred times of 
what it had been before within two generations.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Oestereich, B., &amp; Schröder, C. (2017). Das kollegial geführte Unternehmen: Ideen und Praktiken für die agile Organisation von morgen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 Since the 1980s, market dynamism has again risen drastically, as market
 liberalisation, the invention of the internet and global trade have 
resulted in networking on a wider scale. In the new network economy, all
 players operate globally. The planning and controlling methods, which 
resulted in great value creation under Taylorism, cannot longer cope 
with the speed and complexity of today’s dynamic markets.</p>

 most companies in the Fortune 500 have failed to master these 
challenges in the last sixty years. Only 60 of the Fortune 500 companies
 from the year 1955 still belonged to this group in 2016. An explanation
 for this big fluctuation of companies can be supplied by disruption 
theory. At the beginning of the 1990s, the economist Clayton M. 
Christensen of the Harvard Business School defined the phenomenon of 
disruptive innovation. Disruptive innovations are described as 
innovations making products and services more accessible and affordable,
 and resulting in the acquisition of many more customers.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Christensen C.

    <p>What are organisational forms and culture called for, if 
companies are to make the best use of technological advances and keep up
 with the flow of successful digitalisation? An essential credo of 
digitalisation says <em>disrupt yourself</em>, before somebody does it 
to you. This principle was recognised by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at an 
early stage, who commissioned a team to destroy Amazon’s own book 
business back in 2006 – at the time its second most successful area, 
second only to its trade in music. He gave them this project just after 
turning down the offer from Apple’s then CEO, Steve Jobs, to work 
together with Amazon to develop a music streaming service. Apple 
launched iTunes and made massive inroads into Amazon’s core business. 
Bezos realised that self-attack is the best mode of defence.</p>

    <p>Platforms are currently the predominant business model in the 
digital industry as they offer value-creating interactions between 
customers and producers. They facilitate this interaction by using 
digital technologies. Costumers and producers enjoy direct platform 
access to market to use or distribute services. The big advantage of the
 platform model lies in the fact that companies no longer need any 
assets of their own, which tie up capital. An overview of the most 
successful platform companies today reflects this trend:</p>

    <p>The biggest value-creating companies of the 21st century come 
from the internet economy, where you would struggle to find an assembly 
line. Instead, internet services create valuable data amounts supporting
 the generation of large sums of money. For example, they support the 
development of smart machines, facilitate more deliberate product 
placement and feed algorithms which are constantly making business 
processes more automated. The economic growth of the 20th century on the
 other hand was mainly based on mechanical production for commercial 
purposes and Tayloristic organisational principles like planning and 
controlling. In agile organisations, which can handle the complexity of 
the internet economy, these principles have been replaced by 
self-organisation and new kinds of latitude.</p>

    <p>It isn’t just the business model of successful companies in the 
internet economy that differs from the business models of the industrial
 era. We are also observing a massive transformation of organisational 
and working culture. In his bestseller <em>Reinventing Organizations</em>,<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Laloux, F. (2015). Reinventing Organizations: ein Leitfaden zur Gestaltung sinnstiftender Formen der Zusammenarbeit." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 the former McKinsey partner and author Frederic Laloux focuses on 
changes in collaboration and leadership in organisations. In the age of 
digitalisation, old-style organisational leadership has reached its 
limits, Laloux concludes, adding that many employees and executive staff
 see work on the whole as a necessary evil. How can we counter the 
complexity of digitalisation, and how can people be given a chance to 
rediscover enthusiasm for and meaning in their work? The forms of 
collaboration and leadership models need a radical change, so Laloux. 
The crucial question for organisations is how they cope with the 
complexity that has come into being recently on the level of structures 
and processes. From cybernetics expert Ross Ashby we know that a system 
will be better capable of handling a complex and dynamic environment to 
the extent that it is able to make use of its own inner complexity. And 
inner complexity arises through multifarious social networking – in 
other words, it is based on the available communication possibilities. 
It is a matter of increasing the social density.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Oestereich, B., &amp; Schröder, C.

 models and methods, capable of encouraging self-organisation and 
internal complexity. In the VUCA world (the acronym stands for

more like living organisms than like rigid hierarchies, and

    <p>The agility of a company is created through a particularly 
productive combination of stability and flexibility in structures, 
processes and roles. Putting it into a paradoxical way, agile potential 
means that you can decide to act not in an agile but in a rock-solid 
manner. Agility thus needs precisely the decision about which elements, 
in terms of processes, structure and roles, need to be kept stable and 
what elements need to be dynamised<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Eidenschink, K. (n.d.). Agilität | Metatheorie der Veränderung." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>.
 Agile organisations must consciously decide which teams, processes and 
structures function in an agile way and which ones are less suitable. 
Agile companies are distinguished by a radically (in the sense of ‘from 
the root up’) decentralised structure as the definitive organisation 
principle.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Oestereich, B., &amp; Schröder, C. (2017). Das kollegial geführte Unternehmen: Ideen und Praktiken für die agile Organisation von morgen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 Organisations that want to become more agile must therefore challenge 
the current status quo on the three levels of individual and 
organisational <strong>attitude</strong> (values and mindsets), individual and organisational <strong>responsiveness</strong> (self-organisation of structures and processes), and <strong>networking</strong>
 (horizontal and vertical structures, exchange of knowledge and 
knowledge management) to rearrange themselves and learn from experience.</p>

    <p>In companies we can observe different approaches. On the one hand
 new units are founded as start-up hubs to develop innovative ideas, 
test out different modes of working, and integrate these into the parent
 group later on. Another approach is to implement agile lighthouse 
projects, in which the new working mode is expected to demonstrate its 
success. Some examples of German companies, by way of illustration, are

    <p>A start-up platform founded by <strong>Bosch</strong> serves as incubator for new business ideas, which are then tested within various innovation clusters, such as <em>connected industry</em> or <em>mobility</em>.
 A successful agile partnership was realised between Bosch and the 
electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. Bosch functioned as a supplier of 
chassis and safety systems. Many of the hardware and software components
 can be precisely adapted for the various requirements of the individual
 vehicle models. The development and implementation could be carried out
 in half the standard development time. In another project, Bosch was 
able to develop a new, networked sensor solution for asparagus 
cultivation in just three weeks of development. The temperature in the 
earth where the vegetable is grown can be communicated to a smartphone. 
This makes it easier to create the best possible growing conditions. The
 short development time resulted from the use of agile procedures and 
methods of interdisciplinary teamwork. Agile solutions are suitable in 
situations where the technologies, or the approaches to development of a
 solution, are to some extent still unclear to begin with, and where the
 requirements for a new product are going to be subject to change in the
 course of time, says Bosch CEO Dr Volkmar Denner.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Denner, V.

    <p>But all these efforts are a long way from being enough. In his book <em>Silicon Germany</em>
 Christoph Keese draws the conclusion: Too little money, too many 
worriers, too little courage, not enough innovative spirit – these 
factors are dangerous impediments to the impetus of start-ups in 
Germany.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Keese, C. H. (2016). Silicon Germany: wie wir die digitale Transformation schaffen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 One reason for this, Keese thinks, is the German zero error culture. He
 argues that successful companies are rethinking the concept of error. 
Innovation steps become bigger when you are willing to take a certain 
measure of failures on board. And then there is the unresolved question 
of reintegrating the innovation hubs, digital labs, and innovation 
teams. How can the experiences of these teams be brought back into the 
everyday life of the company, and integrated with existing working 
processes?<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Keese, C. H. (2016). Silicon Germany: wie wir die digitale Transformation schaffen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a></p>

    <p>The answer is yes – leadership is always going to be necessary. 
However, it is undergoing a process of transformation. Agility is also 
needed in leadership, of the sort, which is particularly distinguished 
by the fact that it is distributed among many rather than just a few 
people. Agile leadership comprises the three levels of attitude, 
responsive structures and networking. Leadership focuses increasingly on
 shaping the right framing conditions, on rolemodelling the values and 
behavioural attitudes that are seen as desirable and on network 
management. Leadership also has to resolve conflicts, and to decide in 
case of escalation.</p>

    <p>Leaders need to ask the following questions in particular: How 
does this company basically work? What decisions are taken, why and by 
whom? What processes need how much rapidity, flexibility and stability? 
What patterns and dysfunctionalities can be identified? In most cases 
faulty developments are less attributable to employees than they are 
down to the ingrained and daily repeated behavioural attitudes in the 
company. These are caused by structures, and, as a result, give rise to 
dysfunctional patterns.</p>

    <p>A person’s attitude feeds on his/her fundamental convictions, 
assumptions and experiences. With an eye to developing an agile 
organisation it is crucial that individuals should become conscious of 
the complexity and fragmentary nature of the world. We have the choice 
whether we fall victim to the error of supposing that the world is 
comprehensible and easy to explain and that the powerful determine the 
state of the world and the company. We can likewise acknowledge the 
complex interconnections of the many systems (human being, family, 
company, state, economy, law, leisure) and scrutinise polarised thinking
 in terms of opposites like good and evil, right and wrong, success and 
failure. This is a complex exercise itself, as we human beings have 
learned to think in a linear way and it is difficult for us to think in 
exponential and systemic terms.</p>

    <p>Just as with the individual, in organisations fundamental 
convictions and patterns come to be established as well – for example a 
trust-based attitude to people, or alternatively a coexistence 
characterised by mistrust. The values of the agile manifesto, which 
originated with software development, sum up the necessary attitude of 
the ‘agile mindset’ effectively in the following terms:</p>

    <p>But to avoid this being just a scratch on the surface, the new 
behavioural modes need to be anchored in the structures of a company. 
Christoph Keese describes the way in which at Netflix neither working 
hours, working days nor periods of leave are clocked up. The founder and
 CEO Reed Hastings, moreover, does not have a fixed office of his own 
and is a leader of the new age: The Netflix CEO lives out an 
understanding of his role that could become a standard for many managers
 in the age of digitalisation. Executive staff no longer take up a 
position in the foreground, but rather keep themselves back. They hardly
 ever assign concrete tasks any more, but rather put the right questions
 and give teams the job of finding the answers. They hardly ever 
formulate rules any more, but rather concentrate on effectively getting 
across their own culture. They do not hand out instructions from above 
to below, but distribute impulses in all directions. They do not think 
in terms of fulfilling plans, but uncover truths, identify weak points 
and reward honesty. They do not disempower, but encourage freedom. They 
are not complacent, but are always challenging themselves and their 
business models. They do not put on a show of strength, but display 
vulnerability. They are not insecure, but take care to avoid any 
excessive assurance. They do not give orders but listen. They despise 
status symbols and ask for acknowledgement to be based on their 
projects. They do not control any structure of commands, but rather 
coordinate working groups.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Keese, C. H. (2016).

    <p>In most companies, moreover, it is not clear what role is 
assigned to employees who are the object of leadership, so to speak. 
Employees too have a responsibility to adopt a self-determining attitude
 in relation to those in leadership positions: in being conscious that 
no one has power over them, unless they give it to them; that they will 
be disappointed and also disappoint others. Employees can ask 
themselves: am I aware of my changing environment, do I learn from 
others and let others learn from me, do I talk to others rather than 
passing judgment on them, and do I share important information with the 
other person?   </p>

    <p>Responsiveness means the ability of the organisation to respond 
adequately and adapt to market conditions. This generally succeeds only 
when complex problems are tackled on an interdisciplinary basis. Agile 
structures avoid the distribution of work and any kind of 
differentiation in the value creation process. Agility lays more 
emphasis on the question of which value-creating activities are 
necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of the market, and how an
 autonomous team can handle the associated tasks.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Kasch, W. (2013). Agil ist Anders." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 In concrete terms, this means that thinking in terms of specialisation 
and special areas of expertise must give way to a new kind of logic. In 
German industry, in particular, Keese states, thinking and organising in
 terms of specialist departments and specialisations was a big factor 
for success in the past, as it resulted in top-quality industrial 
products. With digitalisation, however, it has become a problem. 
Rethinking the situation is a difficult business, because it entails a 
loss of certainty – because expanding horizontally means branching out 
into the unknown. Nobody knows anybody in this alien field, nobody knows
 what the rules are and people are no longer conscious of their own 
strengths. When a person feels good as a member of his own specialist 
group, he isn’t going to want to get active as a builder of bridges.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Keese, C. H. (2016). Silicon Germany: wie wir die digitale Transformation schaffen." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 According to Keese we can only escape from this pattern with the help 
of a leadership culture that calls for audacity and encourages 
experiments. But the zero-error culture in Germany makes this 
practically impossible.</p>

    <p>Laloux formulates the necessary restructuring in a much more 
radical way, under the heading of ‘structures and processes of 
self-leadership’. In evolutionary organisations the traditional pyramid 
model is replaced by an interlocking system of structures, processes and
 practices. Holacracy refers to a concrete concept of an alternative 
form of hierarchy, designed to bring about greater flexibility and 
release the creative potential of self-organisation. Brian Robertson, 
the founder of Holacracy, defines the concept as a social technology for
 the control of organisations, understanding these as organisms, which 
feel, adapt, learn and integrate new things.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Robertson, B. J. (2015). Holacracy: the new management system for a rapidly changing world." data-original-title="Cited source"><i></i></a>
 The central component here is the transfer of power from person-related
 leadership to power, which is constitutionally based. Immediately, when
 a company introduces Holacracy, the CEO must sign a constitution, 
whereby he or she surrenders power to the agreed processes and rules it 
embodies. Within a Holacracy, recruitment is not on the basis of job 
descriptions. Instead roles are defined, which meet a specific function 
in the company. In this context a person can embody several roles. Teams
 organise themselves. This makes control of the organisation 
increasingly decentralised, because it takes place on many different 
levels. The biggest company organised as a Holacracy is Zappos, an 
online trader with 1500 employees. In addition, there exist numerous 
methods, where it is not a matter of restructuring of fundamental 
company hierarchies. These methods help different processes and 
behavioural attitudes to be established that are capable of giving rise 
to greater agility. The commonest contemporary methods, to mention just a
 few, are Design Thinking, Scrum and Lean Startup. </p>

    <p>The more global networking increases, the more companies also 
become a part of complex networks. The communicative networking leads to
 fundamental reorganisation of work and of the organisation itself. In 
theoretical and practical terms, a company can float in the Cloud 
completely with all its data and can be accessed from any part of the 
world. But its internal structures as well generally tend to resemble 
networks rather than the classic form of an organisational diagram. In 
particular, information technology supports a higher degree of internal 
and external referentiality. What would the structure of a company be 
like, if the company sees itself as being a network? Rigid structures 
and hierarchies, such as reproduced in the classic organisational 
diagram, would lose their legitimacy. The focus would tend to shift from
 positions and committees in the direction of processes and the 
presentation of different hierarchies, like those of competence, 
experience and formal power of decision. </p>

    <p>More diversity and the distribution of intelligence and knowledge
 make it possible for companies to generate more ideas and wider 
latitude of action. Agile companies are permeable, i.e., the 
organisation itself is receptive at many points to the outside world, 
and can feed the information received into the internal processes of 
product improvement and innovation. In concrete terms this means that 
the employees and the company are connected with customers, suppliers 
and other players. It must be possible for the information to be 
internally processed as a matter of routine and in appropriate ways, so 
that the conclusions for business are drawn. Keese concludes that it 
depends on an intelligent combination of horizontal and vertical 
networks. Individual business units can be organised vertically as a 
pyramid. Amongst themselves, however, they should have a strong 
horizontal aspect. Pyramids on a small scale often make just as much 
sense as networks on a large scale. In this model, the task of the CEO 
no longer consists in passing on concrete instructions from above to 
below, but rather in managing the network skilfully and distributing 
resources, like funds and personnel, over the network on an efficient 
basis. The most important responsibility of corporate managers in the 
digital future could be summed up as practising network management, 
creating connections, organising the exchange of information and staying
 out of the limelight.<a tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus hover" class="ms-inline ms-inline-reference" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="" data-content="Keese, C. H. (2016).

    <p>We can state in conclusion that agility must be seen as an 
indispensable competence of organisations in the digital era. There is 
no black or white, however – companies must decide for themselves how 
much agility makes sense for which structures and processes. In view of 
the increasing complexity of our working world, what is needed is above 
all a change of mindset and attitude on the part of corporate 
decision-makers. Classic hierarchies and cascaded decision-making 
processes are giving way to new organisational structures, where 
employees and teams have more responsibility for themselves and so find 
more meaning in their work. Agile organisations are those, which have 
understood that this calls for an organisational culture where the 
consistent scrutiny of the status quo, the courage to experiment and 
fail and the decentralised distribution of power are enshrined in the 
DNA of a company, and not just lived out in the context of a lighthouse 
project or digital hub. </p>

    <p>We connect worlds and people! Coming from the background of a 
large corporate energy company, we reinvented ourselves as the Learn Lab
 (LRN LAB). As a start-up we embark on our own learning journey to deal 
with the complexity of the digital era. Our mission is to support 
companies and people with the digital transformation. Learning to cope 
with uncertainty, in our opinion, is one of the main strengths and 
capabilities in this fast-changing world. As LRN LAB we experiment with 
new approaches in our own team and turn our experiences into products 
and new formats. Customers appreciate our approach, which may be based 
on enquiry and at other times may give them guidance and structure. When
 creating solutions, we can draw from our experience as a start-up, as 
well as from the group transformation of RWE and Innogy.<br><br>Although
 we cannot predict the future, we are convinced that we need robust 
theories to make future-oriented decisions. Our interdisciplinary team 
of agile coaches, systemic change consultants, trainers, e-learning 
experts, and trend analysts can facilitate both major digital 
transformations and smaller-scale trainings for Design Thinking or Agile
 Leadership. In this context, we implement the perspective of systemic 
metatheory, by offering an alternative to plan-based linear thinking and
 taking into account the systemic complexity of companies and their 
environment. Change begins with the recognition that change itself is 
not just another corporate target, but rather the endeavour to 
deconstruct one’s own patterns in dealing with the environment. In this 
process, a new future opens up almost automatically.</p>

    <p>The white paper entitled <em>Agility – a new buzzword, or an ability, required by organisations for their survival in the digital era?</em>
 casts light on the new economic conditions questioning traditional 
forms of organisation and culture as well as traditional models of 
control. Often the solution, we are told, is agility. But what lies 
behind this concept, and what purpose does it serve?</p>

    <p>In the 21st century, the data-driven companies of internet 
economy achieve the biggest profits. The exponential growth of 
information, knowledge, computer performance, and data storage capacity 
is leading to the disruption of entire industries. In this regard, 
platforms are the predominant business model. Companies are thus 
increasingly obliged to ask themselves how they should make use of 
technological progress to become part of digitalisation. But they must 
also take other considerations into account, for example cultural 
transformation, the increasing alienation of human beings in 
hierarchical organisations, and a growing need for meaningful work. 
Agile companies seem particularly well-suited to deal with increased 
complexity, because they perceive uncertainty as a resource and achieve 
greater productivity against the background of internal 
self-organisation. Agility combines numerous theories, organisational 
models and methods, helping companies to challenge rigid hierarchies and
 processes. In this context, agility does not mean the absence of rules –
 on the contrary, a company achieves agility through an exceptionally 
productive combination of stability and flexibility. The development of 
an agile mindset and agile structures calls for a new understanding of 
leadership and management. An organisation, wishing to become more 
agile, must query the status quo on the levels of attitude, structures, 
and networking both within the organisation and outside. The important 
thing is to identify the areas which, in view of new market 
requirements, need a more flexible design.</p>
